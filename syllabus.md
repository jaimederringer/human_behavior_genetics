# PSYC 408 Human Behavior Genetics

Syllabus as of Fall 2023
(with some updates)

[Course Description](ch00/0.1_course_description.md)

## Lectures

Lectures are held Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30 am to 10:50 am.

## Grading

Grades are assigned based on your final point total at the end of the semester.

Points come from two sources: participation activity assignments throughout the semester (up to 4 points per week x 15 weeks = up to 60 points) and course project assignments leading to a term paper (up to 50 points from 8 assignments). There are no exams. 

Points earned for participation activities and course project assignments and are scaled such that each point is expected to take about 1.5 hours of effort, including time to prepare (e.g. read, think) and complete (e.g. write, edit) the task. This is consistent with an expectation that a course takes about 3 times the number of credits in hours per week. In this case, as a 3 credit course, plan to spend an average of 9 hours per week working on the course.

You complete an activity, you earn a point. Over the course of the semester, you collect your points. At the end of the semester, you exchange your points for a grade.

There are no +s or -s, only letter grades. 

| Points | Letter Grade |
------
| 90+ | A |
| 80 - 89.999 | B |
| 70 - 79.999 | C |
| 60 - 69.999 | D |
| <60 | F |

The total possible number of points in this course is 110 (60 weekly participation + 50 course project), although you may notice that the table for converting points into final grades looks like it's out of 100. The extra 10 points are intended to serve as an absence buffer that you are invited to take (i.e. skip/miss entirely) for any reason or no reason at all.

Final grades are based on total points; if Canvas shows a % calculation, ignore it.

## Late Work Policy

I want to be as flexible as possible with due dates. My goal is for you to learn; the timeline along which that learning occurs is in many ways arbitrary.

But it's also in many other ways not arbitrary. This course is designed to build knowledge sequentially. Also, I have to submit final grades by a very specific date and time, so we work backward from there. 

All assignments are due by 5 pm on their due date. (Why 5 pm? Because I'm not available at 11:59 pm to respond to technical problems. All activities and assignments can be completed asyncronously; if you have a conflict with 5 pm deadlines, you are welcome to submit early.) 

Late penalties accrue automatically after 5 pm (5.01 pm is late).

There are two kinds of assignemnts in this course: weekly activities (up to 4 points per week) and course project assignments (50 points total across 8 assignments).

Weekly activities are due by Friday at 5 pm the week they are assigned. Weekly activities may be submitted late by the following Monday at 5 pm for a 20% reduction in credit. Late activities will not be accepted after Monday at 5 pm unless prior arrangements have been made.

Course project assignments are due by Monday 5 pm following the week in which they are "due". Course project assignments lose 10% credit per day late.

If you need an extension on an assignment, you must email me before the deadline.

Exceptions to these policies are only made in exceptional circumstances (that is, those that would be documented by a letter from the [Dean of Students](https://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/student-assistance-center/).

## Integrity and "AI" Policy

[UIUC Student Code Academic Integrity Policy](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-402)

Make good choices. You are ultimately responsible for the content of what you submit. The landscape of computer assistance for research and knowledge production is ever changing. A good guideline is that if you would be uncomfortable describing your process for producing work for this course (to me, to your parents, or announced on a roadside billboard), you should re-evaluate your approach. If you are in doubt, reach out to discuss options and approaches.
