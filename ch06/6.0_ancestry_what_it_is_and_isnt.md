# 6.0 Ancestry: What It Is and Isn't

This week we discuss population genetics and how the statistical construct that we refer to as ancestry differs from the concepts of racial/cultural identity and the social construct of race.

This week we will:

- Learn how semi-random patterns of mutation and inheritance, often within DNA regions of little to no functional consequence, give rise to the statistical concept of ancestry.
- Understand the differences between the concepts of ancestry, identity, and race.
- Introduce how wrong conclusions arise when ancestry, identity, and race are conflated in scientific research or communication.

First, let's start with a high-production-quality presentation of the basics:

These notes are intended to be a good enough introduction to a very complex process (population genetics), which is enough to build an entire course around (at UIUC: ANSC 446 / IB 416). For more details right now, I recommend Dr. Graham Coop's lecture notes: [https://cooplab.github.io/popgen-notes/](https://cooplab.github.io/popgen-notes/)
