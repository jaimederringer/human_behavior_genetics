This repository contains open educational resources (OER) for PSYC 408 Human Behavior Genetics. The last major update of content was for the Fall 2023 semester; it is currently being revised for the Fall 2025 semester.

# Course Description

The aim of this course is to provide students with a clearer understanding of the contribution that genes make to individual differences in behavior. Students will be in a better position to evaluate evidence for and against genetic and environmental influences. They will also gain an appreciation of the interrelationships of biological and social causes of behavior and will gain a better understanding of influences that might affect themselves and others.

In this course you will:

- Understand how the basic principles of genetics can be used in the study of behavior,
- Evaluate the extent to which human individual differences are influenced by genes,
- Consider the implications of genetic knowledge in psychology.

There are no prerequisites for Psyc 408. If you think the material sounds interesting, this class is for you!

# Ethics Statement

The history of behavior genetics is inextricably linked with eugenics and racism. We will discuss the historical and current ways in which behavior genetics has been used to support white supremacy, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and ableism. The use of behavior genetics research and principles to support racism and other forms of discrimination is based on (often willful) misinterpretation of the underlying statistical models on which the science relies. There are reasonable questions to be asked about whether it is possible to conduct behavior genetics research without doing harm to marginalized people. One goal of this course is to understand the forms of knowledge production that are used within behavior genetics, interrogate the limits of that knowledge, and consider how behavior genetics has been/is/will be used (and misused) to impact the lives of real people.

# A Note on Pedagogy

A current version of the syllabus I use for this 16-week course is available [here](../materials/syllabus.md). The current material received it's last major (content) update in Fall 2023.

The course that follows these materials, as I teach it, is a 15-week advanced undergraduate/introductory graduate course focused on developing core competencies that allow for the critical evaluation of current and future knowledge. Because genetics - especially as related to complex behaviors and experiences - is a constantly developing field, and because you never know what you might need to learn about in the future, I focus skill development on accessing, reading, evaluating, and synthesizing the primary research literature. There are no exams in my course, and the major grade/product is a term paper on any topic of the students' choosing (along with an accompanying piece of public-oriented science communication). Even in a large lecture course, I am able to manage individual development of highly specialized/selected areas of expertise by following a heavily scaffolded process (developed over a decade of teaching and growing this class) that helps students learn to learn.

Every instructor or textbook author necessarily makes decisions about what content to include, to focus on, to elevate or gloss over, and I am no different. There is no such thing as a neutral presentaion of any topic, much less one that has such profound and personal implications for individuals and society. For this reason, the material is not written as if by a neutral third party - I very intentionally present information from my first-person perspective, as both an expert in the field and as a whole human being. 

This course is designed differently than the typical human behavior genetics course. The focus is less on preparing STEM-focused students to be academic or industry researchers (although many of my students certainly go that way) and more on preparing a diverse range of undergrads and graduate students to be consumers, caregivers, and citizens in a world where genetics is increasingly marketed as a way to make critically important decisions, both personally and as a society.

If you are looking for material that takes a more standard approach to an introduction to human behavior genetics, I recommend Scott Stoltenberg's [Foundations of Behavior Genetics](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/foundations-of-behavior-genetics/D56A9C68E53ED87EAD1E5529A88CC3D0#overview) textbook and/or Matt McGue's [Introduction to Behavioral Genetics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/behavioralgenetics) course on Coursera.

- Alexander, S. (2019 May 7). 5-HTTLPR: A pointed Review. Slate Star Codex. https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/07/5-httlpr-a-pointed-review/
--	This blog post provides an excellent overview of the empirical research and research culture that lead to the rise and fall of 5-HTTLPR ("the serotonin transporter") as a candidate gene "for" depression.
--	There are a LOT of comments on the actual blog post, but pay attention to the response from the senior author on the replication project being discussed, Dr. Matt Keller.
-- A quick note on the source: This is a great individual piece of writing, but the blog author has received substantial criticism for his rationalist takes (and some of the discussion that ensues in the comments). Here's some more information about it: [wikipedia:Slate_Star_Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex).

-- This piece gives an overview of methods of applying genetically informative data to causal reasoning. Although it's about "personality," that's really only because it was written for a personality journal; you could swap the phenotypes and environments illustrated in Figures 1-3 and all the same reasoning would apply. The one element that is relatively specific to personality is the discussion of dominance (non-additive) genetic effects, which are not observed nearly as often for non-personality phenotypes.
