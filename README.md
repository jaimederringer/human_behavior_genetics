## Course Description

The aim of this course is to provide students with a clearer understanding of the contribution that genes make to individual differences in behavior. Students will be in a better position to evaluate evidence for and against genetic and environmental influences. They will also gain an appreciation of the interrelationships of biological and social causes of behavior and will gain a better understanding of influences that might affect themselves and others.

In this course you will:

- Understand how the basic principles of genetics can be used in the study of behavior,
- Evaluate the extent to which human individual differences are influenced by genes,
- Consider the implications of genetic knowledge in psychology.

There are no prerequisites for Psyc 408. If you think the material sounds interesting, this class is for you!

## Ethics Statement

The history of behavior genetics is inextricably linked with eugenics and racism. We will discuss the historical and current ways in which behavior genetics has been used to support white supremacy, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and ableism. The use of behavior genetics research and principles to support racism and other forms of discrimination is based on (often willful) misinterpretation of the underlying statistical models on which the science relies. There are reasonable questions to be asked about whether it is possible to conduct behavior genetics research without doing harm to marginalized people. One goal of this course is to understand the forms of knowledge production that are used within behavior genetics, interrogate the limits of that knowledge, and consider how behavior genetics has been/is/will be used (and misused) to impact the lives of real people.

## A Note on Pedagogy

The course that follows these materials, as I teach it, is a 15-week advanced undergraduate/introductory graduate course focused on developing core competencies that allow for the critical evaluation of current and future knowledge. Because genetics - especially as related to complex behaviors and experiences - is a constantly developing field, and because you never know what you might need to learn about in the future, I focus skill development on accessing, reading, evaluating, and synthesizing the primary research literature. There are no exams in my course, and the major grade/product is a term paper on any topic of the students' choosing (along with an accompanying piece of public-oriented science communication). Even in a large lecture course, I am able to manage individual development of highly specialized/selected areas of expertise by following a heavily scaffolded process (developed over a decade of teaching and growing this class) that helps students learn to learn.

Every instructor or textbook author necessarily makes decisions about what content to include, to focus on, to elevate or gloss over, and I am no different. There is no such thing as a neutral presentaion of any topic, much less one that has such profound and personal implications for individuals and society. For this reason, the material is not written as if by a neutral third party - I very intentionally present information from my first-person perspective, as both an expert in the field and as a whole human being. 

This course is designed differently than the typical human behavior genetics course. The focus is less on preparing STEM-focused students to be academic or industry researchers (although many of my students certainly go that way) and more on preparing a diverse range of undergrads and graduate students to be consumers, caregivers, and citizens in a world where genetics is increasingly marketed as a way to make critically important decisions, both personally and as a society.

If you are looking for material that takes a more standard approach to an introduction to human behavior genetics, I recommend Scott Stoltenberg's [Foundations of Behavior Genetics](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/foundations-of-behavior-genetics/D56A9C68E53ED87EAD1E5529A88CC3D0#overview) textbook and/or Matt McGue's [Introduction to Behavioral Genetics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/behavioralgenetics) course on Coursera. During the first half of the course we will also be reading through Catherine Baker's (2004) Behavioral Genetics: An Introduction to How Genes and Environments Interact Through Development to Shape Differences in Mood, Personality, and Intelligence, a product of a project conducted by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and The Hastings Center, which is available as an [open access book](https://www.aaas.org/resources/behavioral-genetics/publications).

## Grading

Grades are assigned based on your final point total at the end of the semester.

The total possible number of points in this course is 135. Points come from two sources: weekly participation activities, including lecture attendance and weekly assignments (up to 5 points per week x 15 weeks = up to 75 points), and course project assignments leading to a term paper (up to 60 points from 6 assignments). There are no exams. 

Points earned for weekly participation activities and larger course project assignments are scaled such that each point is expected to take about 1 to 1.5 hours of effort, including time to prepare (e.g. read, think) and complete (e.g. write, edit) the task. This is consistent with an expectation that a course takes about 3 times the number of credits in hours per week. As a 3-credit course (for undergrads), plan to spend an average of 9 hours per week working on this course, including attending lectures, weekly participation activities, and larger course project assignments.

You complete an activity, you earn a point. You attend lecture, you earn a point. You submit a course project assignment, you receive points as described on that assignment. Over the course of the semester, you collect your points. At the end of the semester, you exchange your points for a grade.

There are no +s or -s, only letter grades. 

| Points | Letter Grade |
| --- | ----------- |
| 120 + | A |
| 105 - 119.999 | B |
| 90 - 104.999 | C |
| 75 - 89.999 | D |
| < 75 | F |

The total possible number of points in this course is 135 (75 weekly participation + 60 course project), although you may notice that the table for converting points into final grades doesn't quite scale at 10% increments (eg. 90% of 135 is 122.5, but you only need 120 points to earn an A). The extra cushioning on each letter grade is intended to serve as buffer for flexibility for absences or missed assignments, whatever the reason. That is, you could miss up to 15 points worth of activities (3 whole weeks of attendance, or one of the 'largest' assignments), and still be able to earn an A.

Final grades are based on total points; if Canvas shows a % calculation, ignore it.

There are two kinds of assignemnts in this course: weekly activities (up to 5 points per week) and course project assignments (60 points total across 6 assignments).

### Weekly Activities

Class attendance counts as a synchronous weekly activity option. You earn 1 point for every class session you attend. Class attendance, of course, cannot be submitted late. However, every week there will be at least 5 asynchronous options to earn weekly points, so if you are not able to attend class you are still able to earn your full activity points for that week.

Asynchronous weekly activities (such as commenting on a reading, completing an analysis, finding and evaluating scholarly and popular sources) are due by Friday at 5 pm the week they are assigned. Weekly activities may be submitted late by the following Monday at 5 pm for a 20% reduction in credit. Late activities will not be accepted after Monday at 5 pm unless prior arrangements have been made.

### Course Project

The primary goal of this course is to help you develop the skills to research and understand issues related to behavior genetics in the future. The best way to do that is to guide you through actually developing your own understanding of a topic that you're interested in.

The Course Project involves developing in-depth knowledge about a topic related to human behavior genetics that is of interest to you by demonstrating the skills to:

- Identify, understand, and synthesize recent and historic scholarly sources;
- Develop expertise in a specific topic of interest; and
- Communicate knowledge to a general audience.

To help you develop those skills, the Course Project is broken down into 6 major steps (assignments):

1. [Ten Scholarly Source Summaries](week_08/course_project_ten_scholarly_source_summaries.md), due Week 8, 15 points
2. [Draft Paper](week_11/course_project_draft_paper.md), due Week 11, 10 points
3. [Draft Popular Source](week_12/course_project_draft_popular_source.md), due Week 12, 5 points
4. [Paper Peer Reviews](week_13/course_project_peer_review_papers.md), due Week 13, 15 points
5. [Final Popular Source](week_14/course_project_final_popular_source.md), due Week 14, 5 points
6. [Final Paper](week_15/course_project_final_paper.md), due Finals Week, 10 points

Additionally, throughout the semester there will be weekly activities that integrate your Course Project topic and skills.

Course Project assignments (those listed above) EXCEPT FOR THE FINAL PAPER are due by the Monday after the listed week by 5 pm. Late assignments lose 10% per day late, where "day" increments automatically after 5 pm (eg. 5.01 pm on Monday is 1 day late = -10%).

The Final Paper is due by 5 pm on the day our "Final Exam" would have been held based on the noncombined finals schedule. Late Final Papers will not be accepted.

### Integrity and "AI" Policy

[UIUC Student Code Academic Integrity Policy](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-402)

Make good choices. You are ultimately responsible for the content of what you submit. The landscape of computer assistance for research and knowledge production is ever changing. A good guideline is that if you would be uncomfortable describing your process for producing work for this course (to me, to your parents, or announced on a roadside billboard), you should re-evaluate your approach. If you are in doubt, reach out to discuss options and approaches. I am a reasonable, practical person, and I can tell you from experience that the examples of (obviously) "AI" generated work that I have encountered have been terrible enough that they end up earning failing scores on their merits alone. We will work through some examples of how AI/large language models fail to reason competently in this area (true for most fields, once you get into advanced knowledge production and synthesis, as we do in college courses). If you would like to quickly see for yourself, try talking to any LLM about a topic you are very knowledgable about... it'll say wrong things that sound good, except you know better. This is true for genetics as well (maybe even especially so, considering the amount of misinformation on the internet that these models have to draw from) - you will get a lot of confident nonsense that to an expert (like me) is obviously, hilariously, depressingly wrong.

Although it's about "personality," that's really only because it was written for a personality journal; you could swap the phenotypes and environments illustrated in Figures 1-3 and all the same reasoning would apply. The one element that is relatively specific to personality is the discussion of dominance (non-additive) genetic effects, which are not observed nearly as often for non-personality phenotypes.
