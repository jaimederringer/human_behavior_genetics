## <a id="citation-quickdraw"></a> Citation quickdraw

In groups of 6, find a citation for a specified effect or study type. Locate the sample size and major finding. Largest & newest wins the point. Tie goes to most highly cited.

## <a id="draft-bibliography"></a> Draft bibliography

Select a topic for your term paper and find 5 references. Pick something you're interested in!

Use APA format for the references. The [Purdue OWL website](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_author_authors.html) provides a handy & comprehensive guide for APA formatting. If you find a reference on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), click the image of the quotation mark to copy the APA-formatted citation.

## <a id="topic-roulette"></a> Topic Roulette

Complete [article summaries](#article-summary) for each reading. Groups covering the same topic will join to complete a unified topic summary. Students will then rotate into mixed groups to share and compare similarities and differences in findings across topics.

### <a id="topic-roulette-reflection-essay"></a> Reflection essay

## <a id="gattaca-reflection-essay"></a> Gattaca reflection essay

## <a id="annotated-bibliography"></a> Annotated bibliography

Complete an [article summary](#article-summary) for each of at least 10 references related to your paper topic. 

## <a id="science-communication"></a> Science communication

Find an example of popular press coverage (e.g. an online news article or blog post) of a behavior genetic research paper. 

You can search general news feeds by topic, e.g. [https://news.google.com/search?q=behavior+genetics](https://news.google.com/search?q=behavior+genetics). Anything that makes reference to (at least) one specific published paper will work, so that you can compare the reporting of the paper to the paper itself.

## <a id="draft-paper"></a> Draft paper

The FINAL paper will be about 3,500 to 4,500 words (12 - 18 pages) plus 10-20 references; **your draft should be at least 8 pages of text** (assuming double-spaced 12pt Times New Roman or 11pt Arial, not including references). The more complete your draft, however, the more useful your peer review feedback will be & the less work you'll need to put in to produce the final version.

See the [Rubric](#draft-paper-rubric) for how I'll be evaluating the drafts.

A suggestion for how to move from your 10 article summaries to a draft of your paper:

1. Sort your 10 article summaries from the Annotated Bibliography into 2-4 thematically/topically similar groups
2. Give each theme or topic group a descriptive title (like, "Heritability", "Associated Genes", "Ethical Considerations", "Non-Human Animal Studies", "Developmental Effects", "Sex Differences", "Gene-Environment Interplay", "Overlap with Other Phenotypes" - relevant topics will vary, but whatever is useful for organizing the articles you've summarized)
3. Paste the article summaries together by sub-topic. Then, paste the sub-topics together, including the descriptive title as the sub-header for that section.
4. Before the first topic, write an introduction: what is your topic, and why is it important?
5. After the last topic, write a Discussion section where you briefly summarize what your above detailed description of the current literature shows, and what in your opinion would be the best recommended next steps for research on this topic to move forward.
6. Once you have this rough first draft, edit with special consideration toward the issues we identified in the [Science Communication activity](#science-communication) of how to summarize research: Good, Bad, Improve, and Follow-Up.
7. If you notice while editing that one (or more) of your subtopics is a little sparse, find additional research on that topic to fill out what you already have.

### <a id="draft-paper-rubric"></a> Rubric

| | Proficient | Competent | Novice |
|-|-|-|-|
| Topic Coverage | **3** = Provides broad coverage of a range of behavior genetic approaches to the topic, or in-depth coverage of a specific area/methods of genetic research on the topic. | **1.5** | **0** = Presented research is not clearly related to course themes. |
| Variety of References | **3** = Information comes from a variety of primary research reports. | **1.5** | **0** = Over-reliance on one or two existing review papers of the topic **and/or** excessive use of quotations (research findings not restated in student's own words).
| Organization | **2** = Provides a coherent/logical flow between topics. Includes some elements of synthesis or overall summary. | **1** | **0** = Information is presented as if in list format, with no transition or synthesis across findings. |
| Grammar | **2** = Easy to read. (Does not need to be free of minor grammar or spelling errors or in final/perfect APA format, as long as content is clear.) | **1** | **0** = Widespread grammar/spelling errors or sentence fragments make draft unreadable. |

| | Proficient | Competent | Novice |
|-|-|-|-|
| Topic Coverage | **6** = Provides broad coverage of a range of behavior genetic approaches to the topic, or in-depth coverage of a specific area/method of genetic research on the topic. Information comes from a variety of primary research reports and includes the student's own synthesis or summary of the current research literature. Concepts are clearly presented and technical terms are defined. | **3** = Coverage of the topic is superficial. Some technical terms remain undefined or there are points that are not clearly presented/described. | **0** = Presented research is not clearly related to course themes. Excessive use of quotations (research findings not restated in the student's own words). Over-reliance on one or two existing review papers of the topic, instead of primary research reports. |
| Organization | **1** = Well organized and easy to follow with a clear narrative flow. | **0.5** = Specific topics clearly organized into sections, but little to no transition between topics and/or lack of "big picture" summary of topic, either in introduction or conclusion sections. | **0** = Little to no clear organization; difficult to follow or understand topic being addressed or argument made in several sections. |
| Grammar | **1** = Near perfect grammar and spelling. | **0.5** = Some minor grammar or spelling errors. | **0** = Frequent errors of grammar or spelling that make the paper difficult to read. |
| Formatting | **1** = Perfect APA style, including paper structure and formatting, title page, abstract, in-text citations, and reference list. | **0.5** = Minor errors in APA style. | **0** = Little to no evidence of use of APA style; missing key elements such as title, abstract, citations. |
| Response to peer review | **1** = Final paper is clearly responsive to reasonable suggestions made during peer review process. | **0.5** = Some improvements made in response to peer review but several relevant major concerns or suggestions that were made in peer review are ignored. | **0** = Little to no improvement since peer review comments provided on the draft. |

* Has there been popular or public coverage of the article? (search Google & Altmetric) 
* If the paper has been cited, are there any interesting or noteworthy citations? 

## <a id="themes-in-behavior-genetics"></a>Themes in Behavior Genetics

These themes can be used to organize empirical and review papers. At least two themes probably apply to any given BG paper. Note if the relevance to the theme is that the paper reaches an opposite conclusion. 

* Heritability is greater than zero, but less than 100%
* Environmental effects are unique, not shared
* Correlated outcomes reflect correlated genetic effects
* Outcomes are polygenic (many genes of small effect)
* Heritability increases with age
* Gene-environment correlation
* Gene-environment interaction
* Abnormal is normal
