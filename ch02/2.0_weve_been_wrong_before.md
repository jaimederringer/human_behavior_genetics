# 2.0 We've Been Wrong Before

Behavior genetics is perhaps best known for our spectacular failures, both in terms of venturing into public policy (eugenics) and producing a popular treasure trove of false-positive results (classic candidate gene studies) that are, unfortunately, the only BG research most people have ever heard of. So this is the "history of the field" week.

This week we will:

- Understand the history, methods, and limitations of candidate gene studies.
- Become familiar with the history of eugenic programs in the US and worldwide.
