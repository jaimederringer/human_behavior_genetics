	- This is a standard "history of the field" text. A couple of fun and relevant facts: the first organizational meeting that would become the Behavior Genetics Association (BGA) took place at UIUC in 1970.

	- A key statement on the relevance of this week's material: "The history of our field is inextricably linked with racism, including the misuse of behavior genetic research to support violent eugenic policies." This is a marked divergence from the response to the 1995 Glayde Whitney Affair as described in Loehlin (2009).
