	- A key statement on the relevance of this week's material: "The history of our field is inextricably linked with racism, including the misuse of behavior genetic research to support violent eugenic policies." This is a marked divergence from the response to the 1995 Glayde Whitney Affair as described in Loehlin (2009).

Skim the Wikipedia article on [the history of eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_eugenics). It's long and detailed and includes examples from around the world.
