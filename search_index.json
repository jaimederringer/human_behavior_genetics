"],["syllabus.html", "Syllabus Course Objectives Grades Course Components Course Policies Course Schedule Questions or concerns?", " Syllabus The aim of this course is to provide students with a clearer understanding of the contribution that genes make to individual differences in behavior. Students will be in a better position to evaluate evidence for and against genetic and environmental influences. They will also gain an appreciation of the interrelationships of biological and social causes of behavior and will gain a better understanding of influences that might affect themselves and others. Course Objectives There are no prerequisites for Psyc 408. If you think the material sounds interesting, this class is for you. This semester, we will: Understand how the basic principles of genetics can be used in the study of behavior. Evaluate the extent to which human individual differences are influenced by genes Consider the implications of genetic knowledge in psychology. This is a highly interactive class. Success depends on students learning from and respecting one another. This respect includes the time and effort contributed by each student to the learning of the group. The course will be intellectually demanding and will require a substantial amount of reading, active participation in discussion, and attentive development of a serious term paper. If you have any concerns about your preparedness for this course, please email the instructor at jderr@illinois.edu. This is an undergraduate 3-credit hour course and a graduate 4-credit hour course. The course is 15 weeks long (not including Fall Break). You should dedicate approximately 9 hours per week to working on the course itself, but actual time commitments will vary depending on your input, needs, and personal study habits. You are expected to log on to the course website and check your email a minimum of 4 days per week, but as discussions develop, you will probably need to do so more frequently. There is no required textbook for this course. All required readings will be linked/provided through the course website. xkcd, “DNA” Grades Grades are assigned based on your final point total at the end of the semester, out of a possible 100 points. Points come from two sources: participation throughout the semester (50%) and assignments leading to a term paper (50%). Points Letter Grade 90+ A 80 - 89.999 B 70 - 79.999 C 60 - 69.999 D &lt;60 F Participation activities and course project assignments are scaled such that each point earned is expected to correspond to about 1 to 1.5 hours of effort, including time required to both prepare (eg. read articles, view lectures) and complete (eg. write) the task. Course Components This course will consist of the following components: Prep Work (ungraded) Each week will begin with an overview in the form of “lecture notes”, which will explain what the week is about, what learning goals you are expected to achieve, and in what activities you will participate. There will also be a list of materials for you to review (such as readings or recorded videos). In some cases, optional or supplemental readings may be listed for further study. The term Prep Work comes from kitchens and restaurants. It is the washing, cutting, pickling, station setting-up (mise en place), etc. that makes sure you’re ready to cook a dish. You do not want to be cutting onions or breaking down a chicken when the dinner rush begins and a large table places an order, and you do not want to save reviewing these materials until the last minute when you’re trying to complete the Participation Activities. (Please forgive the metaphor.) Participation Activities (50% of course grade) Participation points are earned by completing smaller tasks each week and are due by Friday at 5:00 pm (Central time) of the week for which they are assigned. Each week will include a “menu” of participation activities for you to complete to earn up to 4 participation points per week. You do not need to complete all available activities, and you cannot earn more than 4 participation points per week. Participation activities may include commenting on readings, posting news or discussion questions to the class forum, reflecting on presented materials, and engaging in synchronous activities, such as attending Class Chats or participating in group learning activities. For those who are unable to attend synchronous class activities, there will be at LEAST four asynchronous participation activity options each week that can be completed at any time. Given that there are 15 class weeks of the semester (not including Fall Break), you could earn as many as 60 points for participation (15 weeks x 4 points per week), although final grades are assigned assuming a course total of 50 participation + 50 Course Project = 100 total points. The extra 10 points are intended to serve as an “absence” buffer that you are invited to take (ie. skip/miss entirely) for any reason or no reason at all. Read &amp; Discuss articles via Perusall: Most weeks will include the option to earn participation points by discussing one or more articles with your classmates through the Perusall platform. Perusall is free and can be accessed by following the article title link provided for each given activity, which should log you in under your Moodle/course identity automatically. The Perusall platform works best on a desktop, laptop, or tablet computer (it’s a bit buggy and jumbled on smartphones). Any article provided for discussion will include prompts and/or suggested workflows for successfully engaging in the inline discussion. Class Chats: In Weeks 1-4, 9, &amp; 10, we will meet for Class Chats on Thursdays via Zoom, a web-conferencing system built into the online course that allows us to meet online in real-time. More information about Zoom is provided in the Orientation Module of the course. Class Chats are intended to be an unstructured lecture-style class meeting option where you will have the opportunity to ask questions and participate in informal group activities. Class Chats will be recorded and posted for later viewing/reference (although credit is only available for those who attend in real-time). Team Learning Projects: Weeks 5-7 and 12 will be structured around completing Team Learning Projects. Students will be assigned to teams based on topics of interest (indicated on a Survey in Week 3) and will have the option to meet with their Team via Zoom on Tuesday and Thursday of the project week (during Weeks 5-7; Week 12 is Thursday-only). Team Learning Projects are an opportunity to work together to learn about and produce a summary of a topic of mutual interest among peers. Late Work Policy: Asynchronous participation activities completed within a week of the original deadline (that is, by 5:00 pm of the next Friday) will be graded as usual. Synchronous participation activities cannot be made up at a later time. The regularly planned participation activities are intended to build knowledge from one week to the next. If at any time you find yourself unable to complete participation activities for an extended period of time, for any reason, please email the instructor to arrange alternative assignments that will meet the course goals on a timeline that works for your situation. Not an actual class photo. Course Project (50% of course grade) Throughout the course, you will develop expertise on a specific topic of your choosing. You may choose any topic related to the course content (behavior genetics), as long as I approve of it. You will produce a final paper of about 3,500 to 4,000 words (12 – 15 pages) for undergrads, or 4,000 to 4,500 words (15 – 18 pages) for grad students, plus references. I care more about clarity, insight, evidence, and the flow of argument than about length. Expect to read at least 10 – 20 published research papers on your topic of choice. For graduate students, plan to produce a paper that you could turn around and submit as a review in a decent journal or a book chapter. The project is broken up into assignments throughout the semester that are intended to build-up to your final paper, including opportunities for both instructor and peer feedback. For more information, see the Course Project section. Late Work Policy: Course Project assignments are due by 5:00 pm (Central Time) on their listed due dates and are timed to allow for the sustained building of knowledge throughout the semester, taking into account the need for timely feedback. Please do your best to meet the given deadlines for course project assignments. Because the course project assignments are designed to build on one another sequentially, an assignment may be submitted and will be graded as usual (that is, no late penalty) until the next assignment deadline. This policy also applies to resubmissions (that is, if you are disappointed with your initial grade on a course project assignment, you may resubmit it up until the next assignment deadline). Note that late assignment submissions may not receive peer feedback and may not receive instructor feedback before the next assignment deadline. Course Policies This is an abbreviated list of policies that may be unique to this course. A fuller listing of general course policies is available to current students on the course website in Moodle. Accommodations The Disability Resources &amp; Educational Services office is available to facilitate the removal of barriers and ensure reasonable accommodations. You can share your letter of accommodation with the instructor by email. Deadlines Participation Activities are due by 5:00 pm (Central Time) in the week they are listed.

"],["what-we-know-and-what-we-dont.html", "Chapter 1 What We Know and What We Don’t Objectives Lecture Notes Prep Work Participation Activities", " Chapter 1 What We Know and What We Don’t Behavior Genetics is a field that is defined by a common set of questions and methods, rather than being focused on any particular topic of study. This week we discuss some of the commonalities, or themes, that recur throughout research across topics, in terms of the questions we ask, what we know, and what we don’t (and maybe can’t) know. Objectives Introduce common terminology and themes in behavior genetics. Become comfortable with the typical weekly course structure. Evaluate and share what knowledge you come to this course with and what you hope to learn. Lecture Notes Hello and welcome to Week 1 of Psyc 408! Each week will begin with some (variably brief) notes by me, your instructor, about the topics, activities, and expectations for that week. This week, our major goal is to get oriented to the course (both in terms of –gesturing big– meta theoretic pedagogical conceptualization and, also, how to use the website). About Me I am an Associate Professor in the Psychology Department. Within Psychology, I’m formally part of the Social-Personality area. I do have a Ph.D., so my titles are either Dr. or Professor. However, Dr./Professor Derringer sounds like a supervillain, and now that you are taking my class we are friends, so you may call me Jaime. (Important note: for ALL of your instructors, default to Dr. or Professor until/unless they invite you to do otherwise; it costs you nothing and buys a lot of goodwill.) I went to undergrad at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh (go Steelers!), where I majored in Psychology and minored in Architecture (after dropping my major in Architecture due to a D in Physics and a Withdraw-Rather-Than-Fail in Freehand Drawing). As an undergrad I worked as a research assistant in an infant cognition lab where I learned that I loved research but would very much prefer to NOT work directly with participants - the babies weren’t so bad, but the parents… parents are a lot. I decided to go to grad school because by that point I had gotten pretty good at school in general and learned that Ph.D. programs for psychology (and many of the social/less-social sciences) finally start PAYING YOU to go to school. I had a general interest in serial killers so I googled “psychology grad school psychopathy” and found the person who would become my grad school advisor, Dr. Bob Krueger, at the University of Minnesota. (Actually, I found his advisor, Dr. Avshalom Caspi, first, but Avshalom was not taking grad students that year and recommended I look into his plucky former student. Plucky is my word, not his.) At the University of Minnesota, I was in the Personality, Individual differences, and Behavior genetics (PIB) area within their Psychology Department. Behavior genetics seemed interesting on paper, but I had never taken a genetics course (and, honestly, still haven’t - I tried to take one my last semester of undergrad but hadn’t taken the prerequisite of Organic Chemistry). Minnesota is home to one of the longest-running modern twin studies, and I spent my first two years working with their data (comparing twins - both identical and fraternal - is one of the most common, classic methods in human behavior genetics). Then, just at the point that I had completed my Master’s degree and was about to formally become a Doctoral Candidate, my advisor took a new job at Washington University in St. Louis and our whole lab up and moved. There was no behavior genetics area at WashU, so I had a choice to make: Clinical Psychology or Social-Personality. I chose Clinical because there are no jobs in Social-Personality. So I began, from scratch, clinical coursework and training to become a therapist. I saw clients and quickly realized that I. Am. Not. Cut. Out. To. Be. A. Therapist. But, happily, WashU had access to something that, at the time, Minnesota did not: genome-wide molecular genetic data. The Psychiatry department in their medical school houses a research group focused primarily on the genetics of addiction and I was fortunate to be able to begin working with them, and their incredibly rich data (which at the time was much more expensive than it is now, and so much harder to come by). I was bopping along happily learning all about molecular genetics when - boom - my advisor took a job BACK at Minnesota. Four years and two moves into my Ph.D., I found myself finishing my dissertation back in Minnesota, back in the PIB area (which suited me just fine, as I’m not sure I could have completed the 1-year clinical internship required to complete a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology). My dissertation was on the genetics of substance use, examining in BOTH the Minnesota population-representative twin sample AND the WashU clinically-ascertained sample whether (1) measures of substance use function similarly across general and clinical samples (they do), (2) general heritability of substance use changes with exposure to childhood maltreatment (maybe), and (3) the effects of certain specific genes are altered by exposure to childhood maltreatment (probably not, but the data at the time weren’t good enough to properly test this). Toward the end of my Ph.D., a relatively new method, the genome-wide association study (GWAS, pronounced “GEE-wahss”) was becoming more common. In a GWAS, rather than testing specific genes theoretically identified as potentially important for certain outcomes for association with or modification of the outcome, millions of individual variants from all across the genome are all tested for association with an outcome (literally: “Variant 1 correlated with the outcome? No. Variant 2 correlated with the outcome? No… Variant 2,000,042 correlated with the outcome?…”). At the same time, it was becoming clear that there are NO large-effect single-variant genetic effects on human behavioral outcomes - and (because of how our statistics work) if we wanted to find individual variants that were reliably and replicably correlated with human behavior, we were going to need HUGE sample sizes (like, 100,000 participants or don’t even bother). My advisor was contacted by a group of economists who were interested in putting together the first-ever 100,000+ person GWAS of a behavioral outcome, and he recommended me to serve as a primary data analyst. I pointed out to him that I had never done anything even close to that. His advice: “Say yes, and figure out how later.” I took a postdoctoral research position at the Institute for Behavioral Genetics at the University of Colorado - Boulder and spent the next two years doing GWAS. The outcome the economists wanted to look at was educational attainment: how many years of schooling you’ve attended and whether or not you graduated college. It’s “weakly heritable” (~10-20%) but it has one thing going for it - it’s a piece of data that’s collected in pretty much every study ever. At the time (this is way back in 2010), the largest GWAS datasets were mostly from medical studies and so had sparse behavioral data available. If we wanted to get to 100,000 participants, we had to work with what we had (at the time, GWAS data on a single participant cost ~$1000 - now it’s down to &lt;$50). Educational attainment is interesting to economists because it’s correlated with a Whole Bunch of Stuff - not necessarily causally, but that’s not always the goal. The psychologists on the project, myself included, didn’t think it would “work” (that is, find any associated genetic variants). Educational attainment is a “noisy” variable - a lot of things influence it, both systematically (personal, family, cultural characteristics) and randomly (luck, war, pandemics). But we figured the first truly large-scale behavioral GWAS was bound to get published somewhere decent, so might as well go along for the ride. We found 3 genetic variants associated with educational attainment, published the paper in Science, and that is the project that (arguably*) landed me this job. Rietveld, C. A., Medland, S. E., Derringer, J., Yang, J., Esko, T., Martin, N. W., … &amp; Albrecht, E. (2013). GWAS of 126,559 individuals identifies genetic variants associated with educational attainment. Science, 340(6139), 1467-1471. http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1235488 My other area of research is measurement development and evaluation - it probably didn’t hurt my application for my job at UIUC as a Personality Psychologist that I helped develop the Personality Inventory for DSM-5, a continuous/non-categorical measure of personality disorder traits commissioned by the American Psychiatric Association and formally used in the DSM-5: Krueger, R. F., Derringer, J., Markon, K. E., Watson, D., &amp; Skodol, A. E. (2012). Initial construction of a maladaptive personality trait model and inventory for DSM-5. Psychological medicine, 42(9), 1879. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291711002674 What is Behavior Genetics? Behavior genetics is a field that is defined by a common set of methods which broadly attempt to answer two questions: Why do individuals differ from one another? and What causes someone to be who they are? These questions are related but can require very different approaches to address, and we will spend the semester discussing the approaches and limitations of our attempts to understand the answers to both of them. Like any field, behavior genetics commonly uses a unique set of terms that is quite inscrutable to outsiders. Some that will come up CONSTANTLY throughout the semester: Phenotype: This is any outcome that we are interested in. It can be a behavior, a physical characteristic, a low-level biological function, literally (almost) anything - except for the genotype itself. Genotype: The sequence of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts that make (or rather, represent) the rungs on the ladder of everyone’s DNA (humans and non-humans alike). Environment: Everything that is not the genotype. This can be what we usually think of when we hear the word environment (family, culture), it can be your experiences, personal traits, it can even be biological environments, like hormones and what you’ve had to eat today, or ever. (Note: the difference between a “phenotype” and an “environment” is in the eye of the beholder - phenotypes can be environments and vice versa.) Why do we use jargon? Well, it makes us sound fancy and, as with all language, it provides shortcuts to understanding that save time once you’re familiar with it. But in behavior genetics, we have another layer of communication to contend with: historical context. Behavior genetics, as a field, is inextricably linked with eugenics (the “father” of behavior genetics, Francis Galton, coined the term eugenics and most of the prominent early scientists in the field were avid advocates). Jargon makes our papers hard to read, and when they are hard to read, fewer people will read them, and we (the scientists) spend less time having to publicly contend with that historical (and, honestly, present) context. We’ll talk more about eugenics and the real-world applications of behavior genetics (both good and evil - but, on balance, mostly evil) in the coming weeks. So, we have a whole field of defensive scientists writing dense papers, either on purpose or (for the same reason MOST academic writing is dense and boring) because we’re not trained to write well. That’s fine if there’s nothing terribly interesting or practically important in those papers. But the reality is this information, and how we arrive at it, are becoming critically more important all the time as technology advances and the potential applications expand. In the past few years, we’ve seen a rapid decline in the cost of genotyping, combined with an incredible explosion in the development of new technologies. Genetic information is used in reproductive decision making (from pre-conception genetic counseling to embryo selection to prenatal and neonatal screening), diagnosis and prediction of disease and non-disease phenotypes (in medical and non-medical settings, including direct-to-consumer genotyping services), and criminal proceedings (identification of individuals and, occasionally, determining responsibility). I keep seeing a sponsored tweet advertising a service to tell me what I should eat based on my DNA. I have one goal for this course: Scientific Literacy. In life, and soon if not already, you are going to be asked to make decisions and buy services based on the research we talk about in this class. I want you to be an educated consumer. There are no course prerequisites for Psyc 408, but there is a personal one: you need to be interested in the journey we are about to embark on. This material is not easy, but motivation will take you as far as you need to go. If you’ve made it this far, and you’ve browsed the course website, and you are still thinking “this sounds interesting!”: you are ready to go. Themes in Behavior Genetics Although there is essentially an infinite number of phenotypes that a person might be interested in, as a field organized around a common set of methods we’ve noticed over the years that, regardless of the phenotype, some consistencies tend to emerge, in both basic findings and new questions/theories that emerge. In this course, we will refer to these as Themes in Behavior Genetics, and we will use these Themes to organize the many topics (and many, MANY readings and other source materials) that we will cover. These themes are drawn from: Plomin, R., DeFries, J. C., Knopik, V. S., &amp; Neiderhiser, J. M. (2016). Top 10 replicated findings from behavioral genetics. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 11(1), 3-23. https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691615617439 Briley, D. A., Livengood, J., Derringer, J., Tucker-Drob, E. M., Fraley, R. C., &amp; Roberts, B. W. (2019). Interpreting behavior genetic models: seven developmental processes to understand. Behavior Genetics, 49(2), 196-210. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10519-018-9939-6 (which happen to be the readings for this week for you to Read &amp; Discuss in Perusall.) We will refer to these extensively throughout the semester, so keep this list (and the readings, for more details) handy. Everything is at least a little bit heritable (that is, more closely genetically related individuals are more similar phenotypically) Nothing is 100% heritable (even identical twins are a little different from one another on anything we can measure) Heritability is caused by many genes of small effect (there is no “gene for” in psychology, human behavior, or indeed ANY trait that commonly varies between people) Correlations between phenotypes are partly due to correlated genetic/heritable influences Heritability increases through development (at least through middle adulthood) Trait stability or consistency across time within an individual is due to stable genetic influences Even things we think of as “the environment” show non-zero heritability (example: divorce) Correlations between phenotypes and environments are partly due to correlated genetic/heritable influences Most environments are not shared between people, even siblings or twins raised together Abnormal is normal (influences on extremes that we label as “disorders” versus normal-range traits are not different in kind, just amount) Phenotypes (means, variances, and presentations) change over development - we cannot use the same measures or interpretations without knowing the developmental context Most behavior genetic research necessarily assumes (because of data limitations) that genetic and environmental influences are independent (that is, uncorrelated) Mating is non-random (although random mating is an assumption of many of our models, again because of data limitations) The development of an individual is not necessarily the same as the average developmental course Gene-environment correlation (rGE) exists and, if not accounted for, causes biases in our estimation of heritability and genetic effects Gene-environment interaction (GxE) potentially explains why people exposed to the same environments respond differently None of these influences exist in a vacuum: simultaneous gene-environment interplay (rGE &amp; GxE) is almost certainly happening all the time, to all of us, in parallel, in sequence, reciprocally. The True Model (if such a thing exists) is almost certainly more complex than we could ever gather data for and test. It is not my expectation that you memorize or understand these this first week. The goal now is awareness - these themes will pop up over and over again, throughout the course, across topics both in class and in your paper. Keep them handy as a reference, and know that you’re going to learn so much about all of them by the end of the semester. Prep Work Below is a list of materials to review early in the week.

"],["weve-been-wrong-before.html", "Chapter 2 We’ve Been Wrong Before Objectives Lecture Notes Prep Work Participation Activities", " Chapter 2 We’ve Been Wrong Before Behavior genetics is perhaps best known for our spectacular failures, both in terms of venturing into public policy (eugenics) and producing a popular treasure trove of false-positive results (classic candidate gene studies) that are, unfortunately, the only BG research most people have ever heard of. So this is the “history of the field” week. Objectives Become familiar with the history of eugenic programs in the US and worldwide Understand the history, methods, and limitations of candidate gene studies Lecture Notes A Very Brief History of Eugenics In 1883, Frances Galton, who is considered the father of modern behavior genetics and happened to be Charles Darwin’s cousin, coined the term “eugenics,” meaning, from the Greek terms eu- and genos, “good genes.” The early proposals for advancing eugenics was through government incentives (essentially, paying) for “eminent” people to marry and have children. Galton defined eminence as being rich (coming from rich families), educated (certainly not universally available), and having an eminent profession (like a doctor, judge, scientist - again, not options that were equally available to everyone). The past and present of human behavior genetics is inextricably linked with the history of eugenics, not only because behavior genetics has been used to justify eugenic policies, which have overwhelmingly been abusive and violent, and targeted primarily at racial/ethnic/religious minorities, women, and people with disabilities. The reality is that the men and women who advocated for eugenic policies developed the methods that we still use today, often with the express purpose of producing data and statistics to support their advocacy. We cannot simply stop using their methods – not just within behavior genetics, but across the sciences overall: Karl Pearson, who developed the correlation (Pearson correlation), was Galton’s protege (Wikipedia’s word) and developed the correlation statistic to formally quantify Galton’s observation that parents and children tended to be similar on “eminence,” which he took as necessarily indicative of biological transmission. We cannot simply erase these men from our history or our science, so we need to acknowledge the bad with the good, and use knowledge of the past to consider how we can do better now and in the future. When most people think of eugenics, they think of the Nazis. In the lead up to and during World War II, the Nazis enacted policies ranging from propaganda encouraging folks to be aware of family history of mental or physical illness when deciding who to marry and have children with, to enacting laws forbidding whites from marrying non-whites, making abortion illegal for women deemed to be ‘fit’ (of good, presumably genetic, quality), registration of disabilities and illnesses leading to the forced surgical sterilization of over 400,000 people. And this is all in addition to the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews and millions of other people from marginalized groups, including the disabled, the Romani, and people suspected of being gay. What is less often discussed is that many of these policies, including forced sterilization, were in fact based on existing US policies. And the Nazi versions of the US policies were not necessarily more severe or violent. For example, the US laws forbidding interracial marriage defined “white” much more strictly. Racial and ethnic identification in the US has typically followed “the one-drop rule”: one-drop of non-white blood (or, any evidence of non-white heritage) excluded a person from the “white” demographic category. The US was the first place in which eugenic sterilization policies were put into place. Around the turn of the 1900s, several states had legislation move increasingly further until in 1907 the first policies were enacted in Indiana. In 1927, the US Supreme Court upheld (8-1) Virginia’s eugenic sterilization policy in the case of Buck v Bell. Immediately, similar policies spread quickly across the US. Non-eugenic sterilization exists, as well. Therapeutic sterilization typically refers to cases where women with extremely painful periods or uncomfortable or potentially cancerous tumors choose to have those organs removed or cases where people choose surgical interventions (tubal ligation or vasectomies) to voluntarily, with full informed consent, serve as a form of permanent birth control. Punitive sterilization is typically non-surgical (eg. “chemical castration”) and used as a condition of release for repeat sex offenders. Eugenic sterilization, however, is specifically targeted a controlling the reproduction of others, regardless of their consent, with the goal of reducing the rates of mental and physical disabilities in the population. In the US, over the course of the six or so decades that eugenic sterilization policies were in place in the US, over 60,000 people were forcibly sterilized. Overwhelmingly, the people targeted by the state-directed eugenics boards that made such decisions were women or girls, especially those who were poor or Black. After World War II and the widespread revelation of the Nazi’s atrocities, public opinion of eugenic sterilization declined. But these policies didn’t simply disappear – the last eugenic sterilization in the US occurred in Oregon in 1981. 1981. That is not a typo. 1981. This is not ancient history. Many of the victims of these policies are still alive. In the Prep Work for this week, you’ll hear members of these state eugenics boards discussing how they made these decisions, you’ll meet a woman who was sterilized by a eugenics board as a child after she became pregnant from a rape. And you’ll meet her son, who was born by c-section at the same time that she was surgically sterilized. The state that did this to her, North Carolina, has committed $10 million in compensation for victims of its eugenics program. Even if all 7,600 people sterilized by that state were alive and able to claim their share, that comes out to $1,315 per person. Candidate Genes A cautionary tale of doing what we can with the technology available at the time In more recent decades, (intentional, widespread) involvement of behavior genetics researchers in public policy has been substantially reduced. Nonetheless, research from within the field tends to still gain widespread attention - the search for biological bases of behavior, genetic or otherwise, continues to hold our fascination worldwide. In the late 20th century, the development of novel technologies allowed us to partially read small parts of the genome (to describe this process broadly, we tend to use the word “genotype” as a verb, as shorthand for “read the genotype”). Example image of PCR gel eletrophoresis showing several columns with variable distributions of horizontal black bands In the olden days, we weren’t able to obtain full genome reads, however. Genotyping required targeting specific sequences within the DNA, cutting them away from the rest of the surrounding DNA, and investigating them intentionally. Similar techniques can be used for a variety of applications in genetic research and application (including cutting DNA into small bits, running them across an electrophoresis gel, and comparing the results across two individuals, say a suspect and DNA found at a crime scene - a process you’ve likely seen depicted in countless crime dramas). In behavior genetics, our application of this technology took the form of candidate gene research - if we knew in advance what gene (or, even more specifically, which variant within a gene) we wanted to study, we could cut out just that part, amplify it, and determine the genotype at that targeted location. The classic candidate genes are the variants that you’re most likely to have heard are associated with human behavior. 5-HTT-LPR, MAOA-uVNTR, COMT-Val158Met, DRD4-7R all emerged as major candidate genes for human behavior in the 1990s and 2000s. The term candidate gene, however, is a pretty serious misnomer. Genes are huge, complicated things, with many sections that can be read in many variable ways (this is how your same DNA in every cell of your body can create so many different tissues and organs - the genotype is unchanged, but how it is read differs across tissue types). And even their “thing”-ness is questionable; debates around how to define “a gene” are still very much around, as we develop our understanding of the variable reads (including alternative start-stop locations, meaning that genes are not only next to each other but can also overlap), regulatory elements upstream and sometimes downstream of the genes, and the role of intronic elements (the non-coding parts of the genes, in contrast with the coding exonic regions). Candidate genes would be more accurately called candidate VARIANTS. They almost never refer to the entire gene; rather, they represent the targeted investigation of a single variant among potentially hundreds within a gene (that within-gene variant specification is what is labeled after the “-” in my gene list at the start of this paragraph). So, how did we choose which genes and which variants to go after? The genes were relatively easy to compile a shortlist of. We looked to non-human animal research, which had been investigating the consequences of removing an entire gene from model organisms, like mice, fruit flies, and worms. Luckily, much of the genome is conserved across species during evolution. That is, most of our DNA isn’t working at making us specifically human or specifically ourselves, it’s just trying to keep the basic functions of life going (breathing, eating, making sure our cells stick together). As a result, we share many genes (and biological systems) with other species, so when we find a gene that, say, substantially alters how dopamine is processed, and we know from dopamine administration trials in humans and non-humans that dopamine changes behavior (including things like risk-taking) we can be optimistic that the particular gene identified in the model organisms would be an interesting target within humans. Picking the specific variant was more tricky, especially in the late 20th century when model organism research (and technology) was largely limited to targeting the removal of whole genes. In genotyping, a whole gene was too much, especially if we wanted to characterize naturally occurring variation among individuals (not just gene present versus gene absence). You might think that the variants within genes (your -LPRs, -uVNTRs, -Val158Mets, -7Rs, etc.) were selected because they were known to have the greatest impact on gene function (or even organism behavior). The reality is much more mundane and practical. Specific variants were chosen within these candidate genes for one primary reason - they were relatively easy to genotype. DNA has a physical structure, with turns, and folds, and repetitions that make certain parts harder to target and access than others. For the most part, what we refer to as candidate genes were selected because they were one of the hundreds of potential variants within large genes of overall consequence (that is, you don’t want to be missing it entirely) that could be pretty easily genotyped in a lab by someone with relatively little training. In many cases, it was because the variant regions were large - most of the variants targeted by candidate gene studies are what’s known as a variable number of tandem repeat regions (VNTRs), which means a short sequence of As, Cs, Ts, and/or Gs repeats a variable number of times (as is the case for the 5-HTT-LPR, where LPR stands for Limited Polymorphism Repeat (polymorphism meaning “many forms”; for MAOA-uVNTR, where that lower case u is how we lazily type lower case greek letter “mu”, identifying the specific VNTR we’re talking about; and DRD4-7R, referring to the 7 Repeat version of a VNTR that can commonly have both more or less than 7 repeats, but the 7R form is what’s been proposed for an increased likelihood of ADHD-like traits). So, big stuff is easy to see/genotype, and it was all we could do at the time, better than nothing, right? This week you’ll read in the Slate Star Codex (2019) blog post and the Keller &amp; Duncan (2011) paper about the history of 5-HTT-LPR research and how we wasted countless money, time, and public attention chasing and defending false positives. I also want to give you some specific background on MAOA-uVNTR (“the warrior gene”), whose story runs very much parallel to 5-HTT-LPR, but happens to be the first gene that I ever personally published on, and so is, as a cautionary tale, quite near and dear to my heart. And for that reason, and because I’ve gone on quite long enough here, dear reader, I’ll be covering the story of my own false positive MAOA finding in the Class Chat this week.

Class Chat on Thursday, 11:00 am - 12:20 pm (CT) "],["ancestry-and-scientific-racism.html", "Chapter 3 Ancestry and Scientific Racism Objectives Lecture Notes Prep Work Participation Activities", " Chapter 3 Ancestry and Scientific Racism This week we discuss population genetics and how the statistical construct that we refer to as ancestry differs from the concepts of racial/cultural identity and the social construct of race. Objectives Learn how semi-random patterns of mutation and inheritance, often within DNA regions of little to no functional consequence, give rise to the statistical concept of ancestry. Understand the differences between the concepts of ancestry, identity, and race. Introduce how wrong conclusions arise when ancestry, identity, and race are conflated in science research or communication. Lecture Notes These notes are intended to be a good enough introduction to a very complex process (population genetics), which is enough to build an entire course around (at UIUC: ANSC 446 / IB 416). For more details right now, I recommend Dr. Graham Coop’s lecture notes: https://cooplab.github.io/popgen-notes/ Population Genetics &amp; Ancestry There are two processes that increase genetic diversity within a population. Mutation introduces novel variants into the population. Recombination re-shuffles the existing patterns of variation (what we call haplotypes). Both of these processes take place in every individual in every generation. Each of us carries hundreds of de novo (or new) mutations that we did not inherit from either of our parents. And each of us typically carries chromosomes that were not inherited intact from our parents, but instead, such as through a cross-over event, were newly formed from chromosomes that had been separated in our genetic parents. The fate of new mutations is affected by random drift, selection, and population history. Although many think of selection as being the most powerful force acting on new mutations, whether positive (increasing the frequency of the mutation in the population over generations) or negative (decreasing the frequency of the mutation in the population over generations), selection can only occur if the mutation has a consistent impact on an outcome that changes reproductive success (that is, something to be selected for or against). The vast majority of mutations have no or negligible impact on anything (this must be true, otherwise those hundreds of new mutations we all carry would quickly make us so different we wouldn’t be able to successfully reproduce at all). As a result, most mutations are neither selected for nor against. Sometimes, they may be located physically close on the ladder of DNA to a functionally important variant, so even mutations with no impact may still systematically increase or decrease in frequency along with that nearby functional or causal variant. But, absent this close physical link to a causal variation, nonfunctional mutations may persist, increase, or decrease in frequency over time largely as a function of randomness. The extent to which any mutations that are physically close to one another on the ladder of DNA are expected to remain linked, or correlated, across generations is referred to as linkage disequilibrium (LD). Without the process of recombination, this LD would never be broken down and would extend a great distance along chromosomes. If Person 1 had Mutation A and Mutation B appear de novo on the same chromosome, and there was no recombination, all of Person 1s descendants would always carry both Mutation A and Mutation B. That is, the mutations would remain perfectly correlated or in strong LD; if we knew someone was a carrier of Mutation A, we would also know they were a carrier of Mutation B, even without genotyping them at the location of Mutation B. Recombination breaks down the correlation between mutations or variants over many successive generations, leaving a narrower window of correlation, or LD, over generations. For an illustration of how LD between mutations breaks down over generations, see: https://cjbattey.shinyapps.io/LDsim/ It just so happens that mutation and recombination happen at fairly predictable rates, and so we can simulate how far patterns of LD should extend across the genome if only those two processes were at play and they played out fairly neutrally. When we compare that to the observed pattern of LD (see Figure below), we consistently observe that LD is stronger for longer distances of the genome that would be expected by chance alone. That suggests that one or more key assumptions (including neutral evolution - that is, no directional selection, homogeneous recombination - or recombination rates only being due to distance between mutations, and random mating) likely do not hold in the population we are examining (in this course, humans; but the same patterns is observed across species). In human research, we usually don’t focus as much on heterogeneous recombination or directional selection. Selection can really only be observed across generations, so isn’t feasible for human researchers studying human participants (for this, we look to non-human animal research on organisms with shorter generations. Heterogeneous recombination is often attributable to physical characteristics of DNA (so generally stuff that’s outside the focus of this course), such as the density of packing and folding structures that affect how likely any given segments of DNA are to get tangled. But it is important; very briefly, really important stuff - like the MHC, a gene-rich region on chromosome 6 that basically builds the immune system - are packed really tightly to avoid mutation and recombination, because it works well enough and messing up those core regions with random changes could be really bad, like non-viable-organism bad. More relevant to how we think about LD in this course is the pattern of non-random mating. Although disassortative mating does occur (selection of reproductive partners on the basis of having different characteristics; most notably in sexually reproducing species: different available sex cells), assortative mating (or reproducing with partners who are similar to ourselves) is a common process that plays out across generations and cultures, for both behavioral and non-behavioral characteristics. We typically classify assortative mating under three processes. In primary assortative mating, mates choose each other intentionally on the basis of their trait similarity (for example, “I play soccer, I want to raise my children as soccer players, I will only consider partnering with someone else who plays soccer”). Under social homogamy, mates choose each other due to proximity that happens because they have self-selected or have been selected into environmental proximity (“I might consider a non-soccer-playing partner, but I play and talk about soccer so much that I only ever meet other soccer players”). Under convergence, mates become more similar to each other over time (“At first I played soccer and my partner didn’t, but now I’ve taught them to play soccer.”) We tend to observe assortative mating across three broad domains: attractiveness (including height), moral attitudes (including religious and political attitudes), and cognitive ability (including educational attainment). For any of these domains (except the VERY SPECIFIC example of height), any one or more of the primary, homogamy, and convergence processes could be influencing the observed outcome of partners being more similar on the phenotype than expected by chance alone (again, except we do know that convergence can not explain why people tend to end up with similar-height others). We also know that assortative mating does not occur for certain other domains, including personality and mental health (the average correlation between partners on these phenotypes tends to be 0 - partners aren’t likely to be systematically either similar or dissimilar to one another.) But, beyond the individual differences that we tend to focus on when examining whether partners are more or less similar to one another is a factor that I know, for the overwhelming majority of all human mates (or, even beyond that, all mating pairs across all sexually reproducing species), is a similarity in their location in place and time. Until the relatively recent developments of long-distance travel and assisted reproductive technology (such as sperm and egg donation), our genetic ancestors were limited in mating options by one criterion first and foremost - were we in the same place, at the same time? (After that, of course, the options could be narrowed down further; but same time + same place was the first criterion that applied to everyone.) Throughout the overwhelming majority of the history of our species, our ability to travel has been limited and slow. So most humans were born and died in the same general geographic location as their ancestors going back hundreds or thousands of years. With limited movement across many generations, who do you end up mating with? Well, you don’t get to choose from the entirety of the human population; you’re limited to those around you, who have also been in the same place as their ancestors for a long time, over many generations mating only with people in the same place - there’s a pretty good chance that your reproductive options were limited to people who were your relatively close cousins. Not necessarily your first cousins (although that is the route Charles Darwin took) but, commonly, people within a region or village would all end up being, genetically speaking, the equivalent of 3rd or 4th cousins. So, you’re not mating with your 50th cousins, who are the humans on the other side of the globe, but with your relatively close genetic cousins. And the more closely related two people are, the more likely it is that the inherited some of those de novo mutations that popped up a few generations back in the same person/ancestor. And so the pattern of LD that we observe is stronger than expected - because we aren’t recombining all available mutations across the entire population, we’re limited to what exists in the surrounding area. And that process of essentially assortative mating for time and place leads to even neutral, nonfunctional mutations being shared more than expected by chance by people who are from the same genetic and, usually throughout history, social family tree. This non-random genetic similarity is the single largest signature in our genome when we look at the &lt;99% of DNA that differs between people, and it’s what we label “ancestry.” Principal Components Analysis The way we estimate ancestry in human genomics is often using a statistical procedure (not specific to genetics) called principal components analysis (PCA). PCA is applied to genotype data to describe continuous axes, or principal components (PCs), of genetic variation. The variables that emerge attempt to simplify a whole dataset of hundreds or thousands of participants, genotyped on thousands or millions of loci, into just a few variables (usually 20 - 100 components) that summarize how similar, or geometrically close, each participant is to each other participant. Each component “explains” as much of the genetic variation as possible, after accounting for the preceding components (so what we label PC1 summarizes the largest amount of genetic variation among the participants within the analyzed dataset, PC2 summarizes the next largest amount, and so on through however many PCs we’ve elected to estimate). PCs are used as covariates in analyses to attempt to statistically control for the non-random differences in mutations and LD between people. We take these PCs to have something to do with historical patterns of reproduction for two reasons. First, because theory suggests that these patterns (arising from the random mutations, plus nonrandom patterns of mating primarily for same-place-same-time) will be the largest effects observed in the human genome because selection/evolution is SLOW (requiring tens or hundreds of generations) compared to how quickly mutations are generated and passed down (every generation). Second, because when we’ve estimated these PCs for participants who are from locations where their ancestors have lived for hundreds or thousands of years, the PCs broadly map onto geographic variation. Below is one of the most well-known Figures in population genetics, from a paper demonstrating that the first two PCs estimated from genomes from European participants (each represented by a dot, color-coded based on the place the person lived, restricted to folks who identified all four grandparents as being from that same place) essentially recreates the East/West and North/South gradients when shown on top of a map of Europe. This pattern, where genetic mutations track geographic locations has been shown over and over across the world, wherever there is a substantial population that has been relatively stationary for hundreds or thousands of years. Genomic ancestry patterns don’t just track geographic limitations on patterns of mating, however. If, for example, there exists a religion that for hundreds or thousands of years encourages its adherents to marry with other members of the same religion, you end up with similar patterns of distinguishing mutations popping up and being passed down within that lineage; this is how we can estimate genetic signatures of certain religious or cultural groups. One example of genomic transmission running in parallel to cultural transmission resulting in culturally identified PCs is among Ashkenazi Jews. Because of a long-running cultural emphasis on within-religion marriage, if you are of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage (which I am), you and I are likely the genetic equivalent of third or fourth cousins, even if our social genealogies would not identify a specific common ancestor that recently (within the past 4 or 5 generations). It does NOT mean, however, that the ancestry-informative markers that the PCA process uses to cluster us together as genetically similar have any impact on our traits, and it certainly doesn’t mean that there are any genes that make us Jewish. As an example, Judaism is traditionally considered to be transmitted through the mother’s line, but I am only “genetically Jewish” on my father’s side; in accordance with our culture’s traditional rules, I am considered Jewish because my Scandinavian-ancestry mother converted to Judaism before I was born; personally, I identify as Jewish because I was raised in the traditions, had a bat mitzvah (I had a moon bounce at my party!), and care deeply about bagels and deli (the Jewish side of my family is from Hoboken, New Jersey - so place and culture are both confounded with ancestry for me). Genomic ancestry does not tell us about identity or experience - it is simply a statistical signal that arises from who your genetic ancestors were (and even then, not all of them; the way probability works - you only get 50% of DNA from each genetic parent - means that many of your ancestors, especially several generations back, may not be directly represented in your DNA at all). Unfortunately for our ability to figure out “what genes do”, genes are constantly, for most people throughout most of human history, passed down within families in a very similar pattern to how culture, or environmental exposures, or resource availability may track over time. And these spurious associations between background ancestry and environmental outcomes can arise even over a short period of time. For example, suppose it were suddenly decreed that all Icelanders must wear tophats. The policy takes effect on Jan 1. On Jan 2, you collect data from all over the world on tophat-wearing, along with DNA. You would find that the mutations that happen to appear among Icelanders more than among other ancestries are strongly correlated with tophat-wearing. But if you ‘controlled for’ (Icelandic and other) ancestry by including principal components as covariates in your statistical analysis, those correlations between genetic variants and tophat-wearing would disappear. The problem is, because these spurious correlations between ancestry and environment can occur quickly, it means that to fully account for them we must be certain that we are accounting for even relatively recent (that is, single generation) passing of novel mutations. Practically speaking, we cannot collect enough data (either in quantity or detail) from among putatively unrelated folks to estimated ancestry at this necessary level of detail. For this, we must use what is currently considered the gold standard for statistical control for background ancestry, which is to examine effects only among participants from the same family (that is, siblings). Because it is much more difficult to collect family data than to just include all available participants, most studies seeking to identify genetic associations with any phenotype are still subject to the potential confounding effect of ancestry - it is incredibly difficult to rule out parallel environmental effects as an explanation (that is, this is a form of gene-environment correlation). The Figures below show a real-world example of what happens when you fail to account for genomic ancestry in a situation where the outcome is confounded (or correlated for artificial, not causal, reasons) with genomic ancestry. The Figure below this paragraph illustrates a study interested in identifying genetic variants associated with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, the available sample was not a random or representative sample (it never is). Panel A shows the number of cases (folks with MS, in red text) and controls (folks without MS, in black text) included in the study broken down by each country of origin. As you can see, the numbers aren’t similar proportions from each country: some contributed only cases, while others contributed substantially more controls than cases. Panel B shows the plot of the first two principal components for all the participants (1) split by case-control status and (2) color-coded by country of origin. As you can see, (1) the countries differ in terms of their average PCs (participants labeled with the same color tend to cluster together), and (2) the distribution of colors (representing countries) differs between the case and control groups. This sampling scheme has created a confound - or an unintended nuisance correlation - between ancestry and MS case-control status. The Figure below this paragraph shows one of the common ways (called a ‘Q-Q plot’) that we summarize the results of the millions of tests that are done in a genome-wide association study (GWAS, pronounced “gee-WAHs”), when we check each available genotyped single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, pronounced “snip”) for correlation with a phenotype of interest. When so many tests are done, there will be some very low p-values (how we tend to evaluate statistical significance) by chance alone. To take that into account, we can compare our observed distribution of p-values (the values used to array points - which each of which represents the result of one tested SNP - along the vertical y-axis) to the distribution of p-values that would be expected by chance alone (that’s the values used to array points along the horizontal x-axis). The dotted black line running along the diagonal is where we would expect the points to fall if there were no effects (that is, if the observed distribution and the expected distribution were the same). Points falling above the line indicate more SNPs with lower p-values than would be expected by chance alone. The plot to the left, labeled ‘No correction’, shows the result of the GWAS of MS when the PCs are NOT included as a covariate. That is, it looks like ALL the SNPs have lower p-values than expected by chance, and so we might conclude that ALL the SNPs are associated with MS. This divergence is summarized by the lambda coefficient: here it’s 2.5, which is HUGE. Once the top 100 PCs are included as covariates (the results shown in the right-side plot), however, it drops to 1.221 (values closer to 1 are considered less likely to reflect substantial stratification). There are still a lot of SNPs more strongly associated with MS than would be expected by chance alone (MS is heritable and polygenic - many genes, not just one), but there’s also some SNPs (densely plotted in that bottom left corner, it’s actually MOST of the SNPs) that are unrelated to MS status. Ancestry and Scientific Racism The subtleties that arise from the often co-occurrence of genetic transmission and exposure to experiences are subtle yet pervasive. Realistically, most people are not super excited about understanding the technical limitations and interpretations of this genetic ancestry thing. It is easy to misunderstand, or to intentionally misrepresent, and the consequences of such can be dire, either in terms of encouraging folks to wrongly conclude that there are substantial genetic differences between geographic, cultural, or ethnic groups; that groupings we perceive or enact are “real” or distinct (we never observe categorical grouping among participants; genetic distribution is a continuous swath that stretches across all of humanity at as fine-grained a level of measurement as we are able to undertake); or that associations between genes and behavior (or other traits) necessarily mean that genes are the cause of the outcome. We often assume that genetic associations must be causal (even though by association I mean correlation, and correlations are not sufficient to prove causation) because genes came first. But, for most of us, our genes didn’t come first, or come together randomly - they came from our social parents, who provide both genes and environments, and who did not end up mixing their genetic material together randomly. And for that reason, observing that a genetic variant is associated with a phenotype in a general population sample is only the first step to understanding how or why that association has occurred - and it’s absolutely not necessarily because the gene is the cause.

Objectives Understand the logic and common applications of twin studies and GWAS. Become familiar with standard formats of tables, graphs, and statistics commonly used in twin studies and GWAS. Lecture Notes Behavior genetics as a field is defined by the use of a common set of methods, usually based on the availability of genetically informative data, whether organized into known relative groups or having available genotype data or both. Because of this strong overlap in methods, once you understand the general properties of a method (what it tests, how we report results, what you can- or can’t- learn from it) you can begin to dive into the literature on any phenotype. This week we will focus on what are probably the two most common current methods: The Classical Twin Study, where we estimate the similarity (correlation) between identical twins, and the correlation between fraternal twins, on some phenotype of interest and draw conclusions on the basis of how those two correlations compare; and The Genome-Wide Association Study, where we one-at-a-time test the correlation between each of millions of individual genetic variants with some phenotype of interest. Both of these are rather broad analyses, involving a lot of simplification and resting on many assumptions. We tend to use both as a “first step” in understanding the genetics of a phenotype, and both can serve as a basis of or launching point for more niche, complex analyses that we’ll begin covering in-depth in Week 6. Finding Behavior Genetic Papers I personally prefer Google Scholar for searching for scholarly literature. Because behavior genetics is defined by a common set of methods, if you’re looking for material related to a particular phenotype, some combination of that phenotype name and a method or two will usually turn up the bulk of the relevant literature - for example, try starting with [phenotype] heritability and [phenotype] genetics, or specific concept/method names, like [phenotype] GWAS or [phenotype] “twin study”. As you find papers that seem relevant, keep track of synonyms that appear for your phenotype, method, or concept - many topics go by a handful of different terms depending on the particular research lab or subfield that they originate from. When you find a paper you like or that is particularly helpful, try looking at the papers that cite it, the papers that it cites, or for other research by the same author(s). I also quite like the CoCites tool by Dr. Cecile Janssens, a Chrome extension that identifies papers that tend to be cited alongside a given paper that you’ve found in either Google Scholar or PubMed. Human behavior genetics is a field that sometimes moves quite rapidly in terms of technological and statistical developments, so papers that are more recent or have larger sample sizes/numbers of participants are generally assumed to be of higher quality or more reliable. But that doesn’t mean that smaller or older studies are not of value. It is important to evaluate any paper holistically, but especially in terms of its methods. Because genetically informative data are expensive (both in terms of the actual cost, as well as time investment), secondary data analysis (or re-analysis) of data is incredibly common. It is hugely likely that the data used for a particular paper of interest for you was not designed or collected specifically for that purpose. No data are ever perfect - we always want more or better data - and no single study is ever definitive. When reading a paper, ask yourself: Did the authors do the best they could with the data and methods available, and are the conclusions they draw reasonable given the strengths and limitations of their particular study? Pay particular attention to how the phenotype was operationalized (that is, defined and measured): Does it seem reasonable (face validity)? Are there any concerns that they might not be measuring well what they’re trying to understand? General tips for reading Track common themes. As you’re reading the paper, consider which commonly addressed themes apply or are discussed (see Lecture Notes from Week 1). Take note of which themes the results support, and which if any they contradict. Recognizing these themes across different papers will help synthesize the information. Note a favorite table or graph. Often I find a figure or table that does a better job of presenting a main/interesting point than all of the text of the paper. When you discover a particularly useful table or figure, make note of it so that you can start there when referring back to the paper. Look for replications. One common “gold” standard for evidence in science is replication. Many GWAS include internal replication samples (that is, a smaller sample set aside specifically for the purpose of replicating any newly observed effects). You can also use Google Scholar to look for replications (either successful or null) by clicking on the “cited by” link below the paper’s search listing (any replication attempt will cite the original study). Keep in mind that science is slow, so new papers (especially &lt; 2 years old) may not yet have any available replication attempts reported, successful or otherwise. For any topic with more than a couple of studies available, try searching for a meta-analysis (a systematic empirical summary of available studies). Some papers may themselves be replications of prior findings, in which case they would usually cite those prior studies in the Introduction. Look for media coverage and reactions. Not all papers receive media or public attention, but where it exists it can reveal strengths and weaknesses both in terms of the study methods as well as the researchers’ attempt at communicating the conclusions. Especially high profile or controversial studies often receive a lot of discussion in public forums like Twitter. To find reactions, you can try searching for the article title or DOI (digital object identifier, now often included on the title page or at the very end of an article) in general or news search engines, twitter, Reddit, etc. Some journals and pre-print servers (for example, bioRxiv) aggregate tweets about a paper directly under it, or may show you an altmetric badge: a colorful circle with a number in it. Altmetric is a service that aggregates general references to papers across the internet and is quite thorough; click on the badge to view the various non-scholarly sources that have made reference to the paper (the higher the number, the more sources have discussed it; the more colorful, the more it’s appeared across different platforms). Some journals embed it, but for those that don’t, you can access it from any paper posted online using a bookmark. How to Read a Classical Twin Study Classical twin studies follow from the logic that regards twins as a “natural experiment”, where observations of a known experience that differs between individuals or over time and is not under the control of the researchers can be used to infer effects of “exposure” to the experience. In the specific case of twin studies, we are drawing conclusions about the effects of sharing 100% versus 50% of your genetic material with a person born at the same time and raised in the same family. Participants Monozygotic (MZ, or identical) twins result from the fertilization of a single egg by a single sperm, which then splits creating two zygotes that share 100% of their genetic material. They are naturally occurring genetic clones. Dizygotic (DZ, or fraternal) twins result from the independent fertilization of two eggs by two sperm at the same time. They share on average 50% of their genetic material and are no more or less genetically similar than any pair of full siblings. Conveniently for scientific inference, both types of twins happen to be born at the same time and the overwhelming majority are raised together, so we can ask ourselves: How similar are MZ twins to one another? And are MZ twins more similar to one another than DZ twins are? Because the answer to these questions rests on comparing the correlation between MZ twins (rMZ) to the correlation between DZ twins (rDZ), there need to be enough twin pairs included in the study to estimate a correlation well (more is better; 20 of each type is too few; 100 of each type is probably ok; 200+ of each type and I feel a lot better). Effect sizes Most commonly, you will be looking for standardized (that is, sum-to-1.0 or sum-to-100%) estimates of additive genetic (A, or a^2), shared or common environmental (C, or c^2), dominant genetic (D, or d^2), and non-shared or unique environmental (E or e^2) effects. For statistical reasons described below, we are limited to estimating three of those four potential sources of influences on individual differences, or “variance components,” to you will commonly find papers referring to fitting an ACE model or an ADE model. These are the factors they are referring to. How similar are MZ twins? This question allows us to address the issue of genetic determinism, and to estimate a variance component that behavior geneticists label non-shared or unique environmental influence. We usually describe twin similarity in terms of the correlation (r) between Twin 1’s phenotype and Twin 2’s phenotype. Correlations can be between 0 and 1 and can be either positive or negative. A correlation that is closer to 1 indicates that you would be very accurate at guessing the result of Measure 2 if you knew Measure 1 (or vice versa). A correlation closer to 0 indicates that you wouldn’t do better than random chance at trying to guess Measure 2 from Measure 1 (or vice versa). A positive correlation indicates that as the scores on one measure go up, the scores on the other measure are expected to go up; a negative correlation means that as scores on one measure go up, scores on the other go down. If the only influence on an outcome was genetics, and MZ twins share 100% of the same DNA, then we would expect the MZ twin correlation (rMZ) to be exactly equal to 1. Any rMZ lower than 1 suggests that there are non-genetic influences on the twins’ phenotypes that make them different. They could potentially be anything: different experiences, similar experiences responded to differently by each twin, or just pure measurement error (when we measure something poorly, it cannot correlate highly with other measures). We refer to these difference-making experiential factors as non-shared or unique environmental influences (E), and can estimate them from just rMZ using a Falconer (the guy who derived it) equation of: (eq. 4.1) E = 1 - rMZ We might have a problem if rMZ ever went negative (as in, if one twin becoming more something led the other twin to become less of that thing), but practically speaking that doesn’t happen for any of the measures that we use. It’s important to note that to calculate rMZ and estimate E, all we need to measure is the phenotype. We haven’t measured anything specific about E, so we can’t really say for sure what ‘E’ is - we just know that it’s stuff that is unshared or unique between MZ twins, even those raised in the same household. Are MZ twins more similar than DZ twins? Knowing whether and how much MZ twins are more similar than DZ twins allows us to estimate two other influences on individual differences (or variance components). One is additive genetic influences (A), a second is shared or common environmental influences (C), and a third is dominant genetic influences (D). There are no typos in the preceding sentences; when we only know the MZ twin correlation (rMZ) and the DZ twin correlation (rDZ), we’re going to need to choose whether we estimate C or D, but we can use the twin correlations to guide the choice. If rMZ is greater than rDZ, that suggests that there is something systematically making MZ twins more similar to one another on the phenotype than DZ twins - but what do MZ twins share more in common than DZ twins? We assume that it is genetics, and Falconer derived a handy estimate of additive genetic influences, which presumes that DZ twins are half as genetically similar as MZ twins, but still more similar than any two random individuals in the population, therefore additive effects could be estimated as twice the difference between their correlations: (eq. 4.2) A = 2 (rMZ - rDZ) Note this would cause a problem (that is, a negative A estimate) if the rDZ correlation was larger than the rDZ correlation but, like rMZ being negative, it just doesn’t happen in practice. Now, we need to decide whether to estimate shared or common environmental effects (C) or dominant genetic effects (D), and because of the limited information we have, we can’t estimate both at the same time. A key assumption here that has gone unstated so far is that the variance for the phenotype, whatever it is, is equal to 1 in both Twin 1 and Twin 2 (correlations are a standardized metric, meaning the measured have been adjusted or standardized to a variance of 1). So we actually have 4 pieces of information: the variance of the phenotype in Twin 1 and Twin 2, the MZ twin correlation, and the DZ twin correlation. In model fitting (even algebraically) you are limited to estimating: the number of pieces of information - 1. The short version is: the math breaks. So, accepting that without more data (such as correlations among different kind of family relationships, which absolutely does exist for some datasets but is an added time and money cost that isn’t as widely available as the base just-the-twins participant recruitment approach) we cannot estimate A, C, D, and E simultaneously, and also knowing that A and E are always non-zero (because rMZ &gt; rDZ and rMZ &lt; 1), we are left to choose between C and D, and to do this it helps to define them. Shared or common environmental influences (C) are (statistically speaking) things that make individuals who share an environment (usually defined as being raised together) more similar to one another, regardless of their genetic similarity. These sorts of influences would be expected to make twins more similar to one another across the board; so C makes rMZ greater than 0, but also make rDZ greater than 0, too, meaning that we would expect the outcome to be that MZ twins and DZ twins are more similarly similar than if that similarity was just down to differences in genetic similarity dosages alone, or, where rMZ &lt; 2*rDZ (that is, when MZ twins are less than twice more similar than DZ twins). C influences can be estimated using the Falconer equation: _(eq. 4.3) C = 2*rDZ - rMZ_ Dominant genetic influences (D) are defined as influences that make MZ twins more than twice as similar as DZ twins (so anything that makes them more similar and/or DZ twins less similar than the simple twice-as-much genotype comparison between the two twin types). This could refer to Mendelian-like dominance patterns but, statistically speaking, could arise from ANY non-linear relationship between genetic similarity and phenotype outcome, including gene-environment correlation and gene-environment interaction. D effects are implied when rMZ &gt; 2rDZ and are relatively rare across all phenotypes with one notable exception: personality. When we examine meta-analyses of twin studies of personality, we reliably find that the broad-sense heritability, or what is often labeled H or h^2 (encompassing both A and D components), is approximately 40%, with no-to-little C, and the rest due to E. But that overall heritability of 40% is about half A, half D (typical twin correlations are around rMZ = 0.45, rDZ = 0.15). Common tables and figures When we actually estimate ACE or ADE variance components in a twin study, although it is quite typical to report the raw twin correlations (because BG folk love to estimate Falconer equations in our heads - it’s a fun party trick?), we don’t usually rely on these estimates for the primary conclusions, and they become increasingly unhelpful as more complicated models are attempted, such as examining the relationship between two phenotypes, or the effect of one on another, or change over time. Path diagrams. Structural equation modeling (SEM) or path analysis allows us to derive predictions for the variances and covariances among variables (whether observed or inferred) under a specified model (that is, we have to define the possible relationships that may exist and should be estimated). To do that, we present relationships between variables using diagrams. The relationships can also be represented as structural equations or covariance matrices, but most people would rather have a picture. The first-ever path diagram (below, by Sewell Wright) was all about guinea pig inheritance. Now we sadly use circles, squares, and triangles in place of guinea pigs, but the interpretation is largely the same. Arrows indicate a directional influence from one thing (at the base of the arrow) to another (at the point). A double-headed arrow indicated a correlation between two things, without implying a particular direction. Concepts that are represented by squares are manifest variables (things that were actually observed or measured; in a twin study, these would be the phenotype measures of Twin 1 and Twin 2). Circles indicate latent variables (things that are not actually observed or measured, but rather are inferred to exist based on the statistical properties of the observed data; in a twin study, A, C, D, and E are latent variables). The number placed along a single- or double-headed arrow indicates the strength of the relationship that exists between the two variables. There are some really neat characteristics of path diagrams that allow you to infer the relationship between disparate manifest and/or latent variables by multiplying the parameters along connecting paths. Most importantly, it’s a flexible, universal notation methodology that allows us to change, add, and remove concepts and relationships and still be able to convey our statistical model to a wide audience. So, you’re going to FREQUENTLY encounter path diagrams in the twin study literature. There is exactly one difference between the pictures below, which are the path diagrams describing a standard ACE twin model. It is the entire basis of all of our estimates from classical twin studies. Note: The difference between the set-up for an ACE model versus the setup for an ADE model is whether the correlation between Twin 1 and Twin 2 “middle” component is 1.0 in both the MZ and DZ models (estimating C, which is shared 100% between twins regardless of zygosity), but 1.0 in the MZ model and 0.25 in the DZ model (which would estimate D, which is shared more than twice as much between MZs than DZs). Model fit statistics. When these and similar models are estimated, we use a method called Maximum Likelihood Estimation, where a program estimates that most likely values of a population or model parameter value given the observed data. Essentially, it runs through a guess-and-check process: pick some parameter values, see how well they reproduce the observed data, adjust, check again, until further adjustments don’t get any closer to matching the actual data. This is (thankfully) an automated process, so typically 10,000 iterations (or guess-and-check steps) get you a model that is as close as you’ll get to observed reality, given the model that you’ve asked the computer to estimate. One way we commonly compare alternative models is by looking at model fit statistics. There are a huge variety of ways we can summarize “how well the final model fits the observed data.” Typically model comparisons are made in a table that will have a (hopefully) clear note including what models were compared and how the “best” model was determined (some common measures are AIC and BIC, where smaller numbers are better, and RMSEA, where smaller numbers are also better but for different reasons, and CFI and TLI, where larger numbers are better). But, in the end, it’s the conclusion that matters and these model fit statistics rarely (or debatably) have any absolute interpretation - there’s never going to be a conclusion that suggests they’ve found the True model, just identification of one that was tested better fitting the current data than the others that happen to be tested/testable (again, constrained by information provided by the available data). Alternative models to compare typically try adding or dropping concepts, or fixing or freeing parameters, and see which of many models does the best job reproducing the observed data. Typically, the researchers will identify the best model that was tested on the current data (using whatever metric) and focus on the results of that one model in particular. How to Read a GWAS A genome-wide association study (GWAS, pronounced “GEE-wah-s”) is an exploratory method for discovering correlations between any one of many (often millions) of available genotyped variants (usually single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs, pronounced “snips”) and a phenotype of interest. It follows the process of (literally) checking each variant in turn for correlation with the phenotype. Because of this massive “multiple testing” problem, we adjust the typical threshold for statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05) for the equivalent of 1 million tests (that is, we divide 0.05 by 1 million); so a statistically significant result in a GWAS usually requires p &lt; 5 x 10^-8. (We do not divide by the total number of tested SNPs even if it is &gt;1 million - up to 17 million tests is now common - because the tests are not independent. That is, linkage disequilibrium means many tests are highly correlated, so it’s like doing the exact same test over and over again, where the result is guaranteed to be the same, so we don’t count it against the multiple testing burden.) Beyond evaluating whether there are significant associations observed, there are a variety of common ways that papers use to summarize the (millions of) results. Participants Because of the large number of tests, and the low threshold for statistical significance, and the anticipated small effect of any one SNP, we need a very large sample to detect any of these effects as statistically significant. (P-values are the result of a function depending on both the effect size AND the sample size - so if we’re looking for small p-values, we need either large effects - which we don’t expect in genetics - or a large sample.) For normal-range phenotypes (ie. anything not restricted to cases of extreme, severe, rare outcomes), which is the vast majority of work in behavior genetics, we typically need sample sizes over 100,000 participants for adequate “power” to detect our anticipated reasonable effect sizes as being statistically significant. Take note of any specific participant characteristics as well. Was the same limited to a certain ancestry group? (Most work so far has relied on samples of European ancestry; more research is now emerging in other ancestry groups in the past few years, but papers do still typically restrict to a single narrowly defined ancestry group.) Also note if they’re looking at only males or only females, or to a certain age group. This can inform how we interpret the phenotype and results. Common tables and figures Manhattan plot: This will be included in &gt;95% of all GWAS you encounter. It is a way to summarize the results of the millions of tests that have been performed. For examples, see this twitter bot that only tweets Manhattan plots derived from publicly available GWAS results: https://twitter.com/SbotGwa. The horizontal x-axis is a map of the genome, organized from left to right by chromosome, and within chromosome by location. Each dot represents a single tested SNP. The vertical location of the SNP along the y-axis is its p-value for the correlation of itself with the phenotype - but in Manhattan plots, the p-values are negative-log-transformed (that’s the -log10(p) label on the y-axis) so that SMALLER values are HIGHER on the plot. Basically, statistically significant SNPs are jumping up, saying “Look at me!”. There is usually a horizontal dotted line provided at the level of statistical significance (again, usually p &lt; 5x10^-8) so you can visually see where in the genome (by chromosome location) the statistically significant SNPs are located. Occasionally you will see a circular Manhattan plot; these are the same, except they are harder to read. People who use circular Manhattan plots are wrong. QQ Plot: These are falling out of fashion, but see the example from the Lecture Notes, Week 3, Principal Components Analysis section. The x-axis is the distribution of p-values under the null (assuming no effects, but randomly occurring low p-values due to multiple testing alone). The y-axis is the observed distribution of p-values across all tests. If the dots (again, representing each tested SNP) fall along the diagonal, then there are not statistically significant effects more than would be expected by chance. If there is “lift-off” from the diagonal (and the GWAS methods specify that ancestry principal components were included as covariates), then those SNPs have lower p-values than would be expected by chance alone. Barplots summarizing evidence: There are a wide variety of follow-up analyses that can be done using the GWAS results. Barplots are commonly used to summarize these results. Because the metrics can vary widely, it’s important to read the text to figure out what the axes are indicating. Usually, higher bars mean that thing/label is more “important”/strongly represented by lower p-values within the GWAS results; because the actual metric being depicted can be so variable, we often transform metrics to get them into this “bigger bar = more important” aesthetic. Effect Sizes NOTE: A p-value is not an effect size. It is the result of a function depending on both the effect size AND the sample size. A low p-value may occur either because there is a large effect OR because the sample size is large. Largest genetic effect: Depending on the paper, this may be presented in the text, or it may be buried in the supplement. Because of consistently small individual effect sizes, many papers now restrict reporting of individual SNP effects to summary depictions, such as the Manhattan and QQ plots, and provide a limited table of “top results”, or even a full table of millions of results, in the supplement. Usually, the effect size of a single SNP is reported in terms of its odds ratio (OR; for a binary yes/no outcome) or its correlation (r) or standardized regression weight (beta) (for continuous outcomes). Another commonly used effect size reporting metric is often labeled variance explained (r^2 - conveniently, the square of what the correlation metric would be). After the individual SNP results, there is a MULTITUDE of ways that the set of results may be summarized. Some common approaches are: Polygenic scores: Aggregation of genome-wide variants, summed like items on a test. Usually reported in terms of correlation (r) or variance explained (r^2). We know that effect sizes of polygenic scores tend to be inflated by parallel cultural transmission processes - the strongest test of a polygenic score is WITHIN FAMILIES (that is, how well does it correlate with phenotype differences within a family, eg. between siblings, where ancestry/cultural confounds are controlled). Under NO CIRCUMSTANCE should a polygenic score be tested in the exact same sample in which the SNP effects (GWAS) were estimated - this leads to CATASTROPHIC overestimation of the effect (eg. it’s not hard to get r^2 = 1.0, because the number of variables is greater than the number of participants, so “overfitting” to the sample is a BIG problem). Heritability among unrelated participants: The logic of twin studies can be extended to “unrelated” folks who have been genotyped, where we can ask the same question: to what extent are more closely related (more genetically similar) individuals more similar in their phenotypes? Genetic correlation with other phenotypes: Just like we can estimate correlations between observed phenotypes, so we can estimate the extent to which the pattern of results in a GWAS is similar to patterns of GWAS results observed for other phenotypes. Genetic correlation is typically scaled to range from 0.0 to +/- 1.0, REGARDLESS of the observed phenotypic correlation and the observed heritabilities of the phenotypes (so, even if the observed phenotypes are weakly correlated and/or weakly heritable, they can still show a high degree of genetic correlation, indicating that what phenotypic correlation/heritability there is can be traced to similar patterns of associated SNPs. Because most GWAS results these days are shared publicly in-full, it is relatively easy to take results from a single GWAS and estimate genetic correlation with any GWAS that has ever been done, without needing access to the underlying data (that is, the method requires only the results/summary statistics). Gene-based or Pathway analyses: Evaluation of whether p-values are lower than would be expected by chance within certain pre-defined sets of SNPs, such as individual genes or “pathways” (sets of multiple genes that share some common function, such as “dopamine genes” or “skeletal genes” or “genes expressed in the brain”). This is one of the RARE EXCEPTIONS to the “p-value is not an effect size” rule - most gene- or pathway-tests ONLY give a p-value as the result. The paper will usually tell you what the adjusted threshold for statistical significance is here - it will depend on the number of genes/pathways tested. Keep in mind that ONLY pre-defined genes/pathways CAN be tested - so it cannot test what we don’t yet know. Tissue/expression enrichment: There are a huge, rapidly developing array of methods for examining tissue expression and epigenetic mechanism “enrichment,” or (as in the gene- or pathway-based methods) overrepresentation of SNPs with low p-values in regions known to be expressed in certain tissues or known to be susceptible to variations in expression from a variety of factors (including but not limited to methylation, which is one commonly studied form of epigenetic modification).

Project Milestone 1: Topic + 5 references "],["team-project-core-phenotypes.html", "Chapter 5 Team Project: Core Phenotypes Objectives Lecture Notes Prep Work Participation Activities Team Resources", " Chapter 5 Team Project: Core Phenotypes Although behavior genetic methods can be applied to any phenotype you can imagine, some have received more attention than others. This week you will be reviewing the literature on one of the most investigated phenotypes in behavior genetics and producing a summary of what we currently know and how it does (or does not) fit with our expectations based on the Themes in Behavior Genetics. Team assignments will be posted on Moodle. Objectives Become familiar with when and how to use the Empirical Article Summary template and the Review Article Summary template to keep track of key information as you’re reading. Identify common themes across papers. Create a team summary of your phenotype using the Topic Summary template. Lecture Notes This week our goal is to learn about some of the most-investigated phenotypes in BG by breaking down some pre-selected papers (for each phenotype, one twin study estimate of heritability, one GWAS, and one or two review papers), finding supplemental papers, and looking at their core conclusions and how they fit into the framework of common themes in behavior genetics (see the very end of Week 1 Lecture Notes). I was able to get everyone into one of their top 3 preferred phenotype teams, so keep in mind that you and your teammates have at least one thing in common - you’re interested in this topic!

Make sure you can access your team discussion forum for Week 5 (posted below your team’s pre-selected readings). Make sure you can access (or request access to) your team google doc (posted below your team’s discussion board; access to the doc does require a login so I can see who contributed what). Skim your team’s pre-selected papers (note: SKIM, you are not expected to do a deep-read of all of these). This week we will have Zoom meetings on both Tuesday and Thursday (11:00 am - 12:20 pm Central). During these sessions, you will work together to: [Tuesday] Complete an Empirical Article Summary for your twin study and GWAS papers and a Review Article Summary for your review paper(s). [Thursday] Draft a Topic Summary about BG research on your phenotype. As always, there are four asynchronous options to contribute to your team effort this week. However, I encourage you to attend this week’s Zoom sessions if at all possible, because working through these activities as a group is the easiest way to develop these skills. As I work through providing feedback on your topic and reference selections, it’s a good time to look ahead to Project Milestone 2: 10 article summaries, which is due at the end of week 8 (Friday, October 16). For that assignment, you’ll be using the same Empirical Article Summary and Review Article Summary templates that you’re working with this week. If you start working on your 10 article summaries this week, you can do 2-3 per week and be done on time. Prep Work Below is a listing of materials to review early in the week. Although these activities do not earn points, they will prepare you to undertake the Participation Activities and Course Project assignments. Skim the papers posted on your team’s resources list below Your team will be working together to create formal summaries of these papers during Tuesday’s Zoom session, but you should become generally familiar with them before/even if you’re not attending Tuesday’s Zoom session. Each team starts with one twin study, one GWAS, and one or two review papers. Participation Activities You can earn up to 4 points for participation activities each week by selecting and completing tasks from the “menu” listed below. You may complete more than four tasks if you’d like, but the maximum number of points awarded will be 4 per week. Each activity is worth 1 point. Find an empirical article (other than those that have been pre-selected) about the genetics of your team’s phenotype, fill out an Empirical Article Summary template, and post your summary to your team’s discussion forum. Make the subject of your post: [summary] Article title (N = number of participants). Find a popular media piece about the genetics of your team’s phenotype, find the published journal article that it is reporting, and post both to your team’s discussion forum. Make the subject of your post: [scicomm] Popular media piece title Write a tweet thread (4 or more tweets, &lt;280 characters each, link/image/gifs optional) about the genetics of your team’s phenotype (citing the pre-selected readings and/or papers that have been posted to your team’s discussion forum) and post it to your team’s discussion forum. Make the subject of your post: [tweets] First few words of the first tweet. For some inspiration, check out this twitter list of authors whose work you have/will read in this class, plus some of my favorite scicommers. Important: You are not required to actually tweet anything; it’s enough to prepare &amp; post here the text/images in that style. Journal: Editing Do some editing of your team’s Topic Summary draft (in the team google doc, produced during the Thursday live Zoom session). For example: Add information from posts in your team’s discussion forum. Add details about individual studies to existing text: sample sizes, participant characteristics, phenotype operationalizations, effect sizes, replication attempts. Paraphrase direct quotes; only quote something directly if the original phrasing was so perfect and beautiful that to rephrase it would be a crime against language. Work through one or more of the steps of Randy McCarthy’s suggestions for self-editing your writing to edit your team’s Topic Summary draft. For participation activity credit: Write a couple of sentences here reflecting on what you changed or added and how those changes impact the summary overall.

However, I encourage you to attend this week’s Zoom sessions if at all possible, because working through these activities as a group is the easiest way to develop these skills. The readings for Week 6 and Week 7 are essentially the same. This week, you’ll be developing expertise in your particular method. Next week, you’ll be rotating into phenotype-based teams, where you’re goal will be to synthesize research from a variety of methods applied to a single phenotype, with the goal of answering the question: Do genes cause (human) behavior? The challenge is that most of our expectations for causal reasoning rely on the availability of experimental evidence. When working with human genetics, or in many fields of observational relationships between (for example) environments and phenotypes, we can’t randomly assign folks to different conditions (whether those conditions are genetic, or environmental - for example, we can’t randomly assign people to different families, or to smoke or not smoke, or to different socioeconomic statuses). Behavior genetics provides a variety of methods to potentially address some of the expectations and assumptions that would arise from a causal relationship, even in the absence of direct experimental manipulation. As the Briley et al. (2018) reading posted for this week discusses, each of these methods comes with their own benefits, limitations, things we can learn, and assumptions they rely on. Drawing causal conclusions often relies on the principle of “triangulation” among methods: no single non-experimental method will be conclusive, but if we draw similar conclusions from applying a broad diversity of available methods, we can become reasonably confident that a causal relationship exists even in the absence of experimental research in humans. A classic example of this is the relationship between smoking and cancer. There has never been a randomized control trial of the long term health consequences of smoking in humans because you couldn’t (either practically or ethically) randomly assign people to smoke or not smoke over the course of decades. Rather, we look at converging evidence from many methods to conclude that either the relationship is causal OR all of the methods (again, based on different assumptions) just happen to be biased in the same wrong direction (a situation that I personally take to be rather unlikely, but your mileage may vary). In particular in the Briley et al. (2018) paper, pay attention to Figures 1, 2, &amp; 3, which illustrate alternative causal pathways that might result in similar observed correlational patterns. Depending on the true causal pathway, intervening in the genes (if you wanted to) wouldn’t necessarily change the outcome even though a genetic association or heritability would have been robustly observed. Similarly, genetic methods can help us disentangle the causal ordering of phenotypic and environmental characteristics. For example, if we want to improve educational outcomes, should we try to change children (grit, mindset, test training) or change schools (resources, structures) or change families (reading together, resources stabilities, parenting approaches)? Whenever our goal is to change outcomes, we need to identify the causal relationships among a whole bunch of correlated variables to predict which features may be most effective to target for interventions (and we must always make choices about where and when to intervene, prevent, or treat; these decisions are costly and often necessarily mean NOT intervening/preventing/treating other areas). Genetically informative research designs don’t only tell us about genes; they offer an opportunity to anchor our understanding of the relationships among non-genetic factors, as well, even when human experimentation is impractical, unethical, or impossible.

You may choose any topic related to the course content (behavior genetics), as long as I approve of it. You will produce a final paper of about 3,500 to 4,000 words (12 – 15 pages) for undergrads, or 4,000 to 4,500 words (15 – 18 pages) for grad students, plus references. I care more about clarity, insight, evidence, and the flow of argument than about length. Expect to read at least 10 – 20 published research papers on your topic of choice. For graduate students, plan to produce a paper that you could turn around and submit as a review in a decent journal or a book chapter. Objectives Identify, understand, and synthesize recent and historic primary research articles. Develop expertise in a specific topic of interest. Communicate knowledge to a general audience. Project Schedule As shown in the table below, the course project consists of seven milestones leading up to, and including, a final term paper. Activity Deadline Points Topic + 5 references Week 4, Friday 3 points 10 article summaries Week 8, Friday 15 points Draft paper Week 11, Friday 10 points Draft digital media project Week 12, Friday 4 points Paper peer reviews Week 13, Friday 5 points Final digital media project Week 14, Friday 4 points Final paper “Finals day” 9 points Project Milestone 1: Topic + 5 references Developing your term paper will take time and deliberate (ideally, spaced-out) attention. We begin early by identifying a topic and (importantly) making sure that there is likely enough research that you’ll be able to build a whole paper around it. For feedback on this assignment, I try to provide additional recommended sources based on your topic and the papers that you’ve identified as potentially interesting - I can use this information to figure out what specific direction and additional keywords might be interesting for you personally. Objectives Identify a topic you are interested in becoming an expert at. Practice searching the relevant published scientific literature. Time Estimate 4-5 hours Assignment Instructions Select a topic for your term paper and find 5 promising references. You do NOT need to read the entirety of each paper right away but do read the abstract to be sure that the paper is (1) relevant to your topic and (2) potentially interesting. Most importantly: Pick something you’re interested in! You may choose any topic related to the course content (behavior genetics). Tip 1: If your topic is a specific phenotype, try searching Google Scholar for: [phenotype] heritability [phenotype] GWAS [phenotype] genetics Tip 2: Google Scholar sorts results to prioritize highly cited papers. You may want to restrict to recent publication years so you don’t get a bunch of out-of-date research (for example, select the ‘Since 2016’ option at top left). Tip 3: If you find a paper you like, look for papers that that paper cites, or that cite that paper (click the ‘Cited by’ link under the reference listing in Google Scholar). Tip 4: Where an author’s name is underlined in the reference listing on Google Scholar, follow the link to view their profile, which includes all of their published papers (useful if you find a paper that you really like, and you’d like to read more of their work) - you can sort by the number of citations (their most popular papers) or by year (their most recent papers). Use APA format for the references. The Purdue OWL website is a handy free guide for APA formatting. If you find a reference on Google Scholar, click the image of the quotation mark to copy the APA-formatted citation. NOTE: We use APA formatting throughout this course because (1) there needs to be some kind of consistent formatting across papers, otherwise, it would be a nightmare to provide instructions (You: “How should I format my references?”) and grade (Me: “Which study is this student referring to here?”), and (2) this course is housed in a Psychology department, so (3) APA is as good a standard to follow as any other. If you are not sure how to go about completing the assignment, post your question to the Course Help Discussion Forum. Evaluation 3 points for completing the assignment. Deadline Week 4, Friday by 5:00 pm CT P.S. Example Topics Below are some examples of topics that students have selected in past semesters. You are not limited to these topics, and more than one person can choose the same topic. addiction, ADHD, agreeableness, alcohol use, alcohol &amp; nicotine, alcoholism, altruism, Alzheimer’s, anxiety, athletic ability, autism, autoimmune disorders, borderline personality disorder, circadian rhythm, cognitive ability, conduct disorder, creativity, CRISPR-Cas9 (gene editing), depression, diabetes, diabetes &amp; Alzheimer’s, drug use, dyslexia, eating disorders, economic decision making, educational attainment, empathy, exercise, externalizing (disinhibition, conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, &amp; substance use), genetic counseling, gut microbiome, handedness, income, internalizing (depression &amp; anxiety), language, methylation, methylation in depression &amp; PTSD, microbiome, musical ability, neuroticism, obesity, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, personality, pharmacogenomics, politics, procrastination, psychopathy, PTSD, resilience, schizophrenia, schizophrenia &amp; cannabis use, sexual behavior, sleep, stress-related disorders, substance use, tic disorders, Tourette’s, toxoplasmosis Project Milestone 2: 10 article summaries Before writing a paper synthesizing a field of research, you must first develop an understanding of the (often highly complex) literature of that field. We do that systematically in this course by breaking down relevant papers using a variety of Article Summary templates (which we practice using in Weeks 5, 6, &amp; 7). Objectives Identify core details from primary research articles. Identify themes/sub-topics addressed by published articles. Time Estimate 2-3 hours per article x 10 articles = 20-30 hours total. If you start in Week 5, at 2-3 papers per week, that’s 4-9 hours per week for 4 weeks. This is the LARGEST single milestone (by total time/effort/points) of the Course Project. Assignment Instructions In your own words, complete an Article Summary Template for each of 10 articles related to your paper topic. Most common: For empirical articles (that is, papers reporting a new analysis of data), use the Empirical Article Summary template. Preferably no more than 1-3 articles: For review articles, use the Review Article Summary template. Rare for most students/topics: If you use an article whose primary purpose is to describe a method (not a result of an analysis), use the Method Summary template. If you are not sure how to go about completing the assignment, post your question to the Course Help Discussion Forum. Here your classmates and the instructor are encouraged to help you understand the assignment. Evaluation 15 points possible (1.5 per article). This is the LARGEST single milestone (by total time/effort/points) of the Course Project. 15.0.1 Deadline Week 8, Friday by 5:00 pm CT Project Milestone 3: Draft paper Good writing comes from editing. But before you can edit, you must draft. The goal at this stage is to get words onto paper so that we can work together to make it better. You will receive feedback on this draft from your instructor and your peers. Objectives Combine knowledge from across a variety of sources. Communicate information to a knowledgeable reviewer. Time Estimate 10-15 hours Assignment Instructions The FINAL paper will be about 3,500 to 4,500 words (12 - 18 pages) plus 10-20 references; your draft should be at least 8 pages of text (assuming double-spaced 12pt Times New Roman or 11pt Arial, not including references). The more complete your draft, however, the more useful your peer review feedback will be and the less work you’ll need to put in to produce the final version. Draft papers shorter than 8 pages or that do not address course-relevant content (behavior genetics) will not be circulated for peer review. A suggestion for how to move from your 10 article summaries to a draft of your paper: Sort your 10 article summaries into 2-4 thematically/topically similar groups Give each theme or topic group a descriptive title (like, “Heritability”, “Associated Genes”, “Ethical Considerations”, “Non-Human Animal Studies”, “Developmental Effects”, “Sex Differences”, “Gene-Environment Interplay”, “Overlap with Other Phenotypes” - relevant topics will vary, but whatever is useful for organizing the articles you’ve chosen and summarized) Paste relevant (to the assigned theme or topic group) excerpts describing the study or review from your article summary form into a paragraph. Paste article paragraph-form summaries together by sub-topic. Consider merging information from multiple articles into fewer paragraphs. Review the Topic Summary template for examples of how to handle in-text parenthetical citations, whether there is only one source or multiple sources for a single paragraph. Paste the sub-topics together, including the descriptive title as the sub-header for that section. Before the first sub-topic, write an introduction: what is your topic, and why is it important? After the last topic, write a Discussion section where you briefly summarize what your above-detailed description of the current literature shows, and what in your opinion would be the best recommended next steps for research on this topic to move forward. Once you have this rough first draft, edit. Go through these tips for self-editing your writing. Review the Good, Bad, Improve, Follow-Up checklist (generated by the class in Week 9). If you notice while editing that one (or more) of your subtopics is a little sparse, find additional research on that topic to fill out what you already have. If you are not sure how to go about completing the assignment, post your question to the Course Help Discussion Forum. Evaluation 10 points possible. See the Draft Paper Rubric below for how points will be assigned. Area of Evaluation Full Credit Criteria Half-Credit Criteria No Credit Criteria Topic Coverage Provides broad coverage of a range of behavior genetic approaches to the topic, or in-depth coverage of a specific area/methods of genetic research on the topic. [3 points] Minimal or superficial coverage of topics or methods related to course themes. [1.5 points] Presented research is not clearly related to course themes (most often: paper seems to have been written for another course). [0 points] Variety of References Information comes from a variety of primary research reports. [3 points] Too few references (&lt;10) or few-to-no primary/original articles cited. [1.5 points] Over-reliance on one or two existing review papers of the topic and/or excessive use of quotations (research findings not restated in student’s own words). [0 points] Organization Provides a coherent/logical flow between topics. Includes some elements of synthesis or overall summary. [2 points] A mix of organized and disorganized (most often: the start is there, but not complete). [1 points] Information is presented as if in list format, with no transition or synthesis across information. [0 points] Grammar &amp; Formatting Easy to read, with APA formatted in-text and reference list citations. (Does not need to be free of minor grammar or spelling errors or in final/perfect APA format, as long as content is clear and citations are present and an attempt at APA format has been made.) [2 points] Some substantial errors in grammar or formatting (most common: several instances of whole sections or reports of studies missing citations completely). [1 points] Widespread grammar/spelling errors or sentence fragments make draft unreadable. [0 points] Deadline Week 11, Friday by 5:00 pm CT Project Milestone 4: Draft digital media project Very few people will ever read even the best-written academic paper. Sharing knowledge widely requires presenting it in formats that are quick and accessible. Objectives Draft a popular science communication piece to communicate what is known about your topic to a broad audience. Consider the content and organization that you used in your draft paper in a new format. Time Estimate 5-6 hours Assignment Instructions Create a brief piece (blog post, tweet thread, wikipedia page, video, infographic, graphic storytelling, or similar) to convey information about your paper topic to the public. Aim for something that would take the viewer no more than 5 minutes to engage with (for example, a 700-1000 word blog post, a 3-minute video, or a 10-20 tweets-long tweet thread). You’ll receive peer feedback on your draft during Week 13, and your Project Milestone 6: Final digital media project will be scored by your peers on Engagement and Informativeness. The goal of this draft step is to structure your taking some time between drafting and finalizing your digital media project, including an opportunity to see how other people are approaching the same problem and receive feedback. If you are not sure how to go about completing the assignment, post your question to the Course Help Discussion Forum. Evaluation 4 points possible (for the most part either all-or-nothing, as long as you’ve made a genuine effort to submit a reasonable attempt at a draft). Deadline Week 12, Friday by 5:00 pm CT Project Milestone 5: Paper peer reviews All good writing is editing, and peer review is a core component of the scientific process. This is an opportunity to receive feedback on your paper draft, and use the knowledge that you’ve gained to advise your peer on their papers. In this assignment, you will provide a journal-style peer review of two others’ papers. Objectives Learn to provide constructive criticism of academic writing. Receive suggestions to improve your own writing, both in form and content. Time Estimate 6-7 hours Assignment Instructions Provide structured, journal-style feedback on 2 others’ draft papers, which you will receive within a week of Project Milestone 3: Draft paper deadline. Follow the example peer review structure and submit each review as a separate document. If you are not sure how to go about completing the assignment, post your question to the Course Help Discussion Forum. Evaluation 5 points possible, 2.5 points for each peer review returned. Deadline Week 13, Friday by 5:00 pm CT Project Milestone 6: Final digital media project This is the final version of your digital media project, that will be scored by your peers for Informativeness and Engagement. Objectives Integrate feedback you received on your draft digital media project. Produce a highly informative and engaging science communication piece. Time Estimate 5−6 hours Assignment Instructions Once you have your peer feedback for your draft digital media project, go back to your draft and make edits as needed. Try to think about critical feedback as an indicator of something that the reviewer was interested in, but did not quite understand from what you have presented so far. As you’re editing your draft, you may want to think specifically about examples of others’ projects that you particularly liked (or didn’t) for ideas about what to do (or not) when revising your own project. If you are not sure how to go about completing the assignment, post your question to the Course Help Discussion Forum. Evaluation 4 points possible. Your grade will be the average of your peers’ ratings of your project on Informativeness (out of 2 points possible) and Engagement (out of 2 points possible). Deadline Week 14, Friday by 5:00 pm CT Project Milestone 7: Final paper It’s time to go back to your draft and make improvements to produce a final document. If you have earned at least 90 points by this point in the semester, you are not required to submit a Final Paper to receive an A for the course. Objectives Integrate feedback from a variety of sources. Produce a brief report communicating current knowledge about a specific topic in behavior genetics. Time Estimate 10−15 hours Assignment Instructions Your final paper will be about 3,500 to 4,000 words (12 – 15 pages) for undergrads, or 4,000 to 4,500 words (15 – 18 pages) for grad students, plus references. It is evaluated primarily on topic coverage and synthesis, as well as organization, grammar, formatting, and responsiveness to reviewer comments. Some suggestions for how to tackle the revision process: Use your peer reviews as a checklist of issues to potentially address. Some will be straightforward, others will require some thought, and still others may just be bad suggestions that you ignore. Think about how your media project changed as it developed. Were there any new pieces of information or new approaches to organizing your material that could be added to your paper? Review the Good-Bad-Improve-Followup checklist we generated in Week 9. For each unit of your paper (each study, each section, the paper overall), be sure that you have addressed each of the relevant issues. Go through Randy McCarthy’s suggestions for self-editing your writing. Go through the document to check for APA-style, including a title page, abstract, full list of references, and use of in-text citations. If you are not sure how to go about completing the assignment, post your question to the Course Help Discussion Forum. Evaluation 9 points possible. See the Final Paper Rubric below for how points will be assigned. Area of Evaluation Criteria for Full Credit Criteria for Half Credit Criteria for No Credit Topic Coverage Provides broad coverage of a range of behavior genetic approaches to the topic, or in-depth coverage of a specific area/method of genetic research on the topic. Information comes from a variety of primary research reports and includes the student’s own synthesis or summary of the current research literature.

Several noticeable grammar or spelling errors. Several noticeable errors in APA style. Some improvements made in response to peer review but several major concerns or reasonable suggestions that were made in peer review are ignored. [1.5 points] Little to no clear organization; difficult to follow or understand topic being addressed or argument made in several sections. Frequent errors of grammar or spelling that make the paper difficult to read. Little to no evidence of use of APA style; missing a major element such as title, abstract, or citations.

Writing and Research Google Scholar Find and access scholarly publications (mostly articles, some books and book chapters, also includes case law if you’re into that sort of thing) The Academic Phrasebank When you’re reading an academic paper, you notice that there are turns of phrase that seem to be used that otherwise do NOT show up in common language. These researchers compiled a substantial dataset of those phrases and organized them into categories of when &amp; why they are typically used. Helpful if you’re having trouble figuring out how to phrase something. Purdue Owl APA format guide We use APA formatting throughout this course because (1) there needs to be some kind of consistent formatting across papers, otherwise, it would be a nightmare to provide instructions (You: “How should I format my references?”) and grade (Me: “Which study is this student referring to here?”), and (2) this course is housed in a Psychology department, so (3) APA is as good a standard to follow as any other.
