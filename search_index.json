The official course website for students currently enrolled in Psyc 408 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is hosted in the Moodle LMS. For information on getting started with Moodle, please consult the Learn@Illinois Moodle: Student Help page. This course is intended to be an introduction to human behavior genetics with the goal of becoming familiar with concepts necessary to contextualize and evaluate future research and applications. There are no prerequisites, other than the expectation that you are here because you want to be. The materials and tasks will walk you through the process of developing knowledge. If you want to learn it, you can. Each chapter covers a week of class time for a 15-week course, not including Fall or Spring breaks. Final grades are earned by completing tasks (small participation activities each week, and occasional larger assignments as part of an individual course project) to receive points. Each point corresponds to about 1 - 1.5 hours of effort. 90 or more points is an A, 80 is a B, and so on. The class can be taken entirely asynchronously, but there are synchronous activities available throughout the semester. There are team activities, but they’re time-limited, graded on an individual basis, and organized around shared interests.

"],["syllabus.html", "Syllabus Course Objectives Grades Course Components Course Policies Course Schedule Questions or concerns?", " Syllabus The aim of this course is to provide students with a clearer understanding of the contribution that genes make to individual differences in behavior. Students will be in a better position to evaluate evidence for and against genetic and environmental influences. They will also gain an appreciation of the interrelationships of biological and social causes of behavior and will gain a better understanding of influences that might affect themselves and others. Course Objectives There are no prerequisites for Psyc 408. If you think the material sounds interesting, this class is for you. This semester, we will: Understand how the basic principles of genetics can be used in the study of behavior. Evaluate the extent to which human individual differences are influenced by genes Consider the implications of genetic knowledge in psychology. This is a highly interactive class. Success depends on students learning from and respecting one another. This respect includes the time and effort contributed by each student to the learning of the group. The course will be intellectually demanding and will require a substantial amount of reading, active participation in discussion, and attentive development of a serious term paper. If you have any concerns about your preparedness for this course, please email the instructor at jderr@illinois.edu. This is an undergraduate 3-credit hour course and a graduate 4-credit hour course. The course is 15 weeks long (not including Fall Break). You should dedicate approximately 9 hours per week to working on the course itself, but actual time commitments will vary depending on your input, needs, and personal study habits. You are expected to log on to the course website and check your email a minimum of 4 days per week, but as discussions develop, you will probably need to do so more frequently. There is no required textbook for this course. All required readings will be linked/provided through the course website. xkcd, “DNA” Grades Grades are assigned based on your final point total at the end of the semester, out of a possible 100 points. Points come from two sources: participation activities throughout the semester (60 points) and course project assignments leading to a term paper (50 points). Points Letter Grade 90+ A 80 - 89.999 B 70 - 79.999 C 60 - 69.999 D &lt;60 F Participation activities and course project assignments are scaled such that each point earned is expected to correspond to about 1 to 1.5 hours of effort, including time required to both prepare (eg. read articles, view lectures) and complete (eg. write) the task. Final grades are assigned as if out of a course total of 100 points, although there are actaully 110 points available in total (60 participation + 50 project). The extra 10 points are intended to serve as an “absence” buffer that you are invited to take (ie. skip/miss entirely) for any reason or no reason at all. Course Components This course will consist of the following components: Prep Work (ungraded) Each week will begin with an overview in the form of lecture notes, which will explain what the week is about, what learning goals you are expected to achieve, and in what activities you will participate. There will also be a list of materials for you to review (such as readings or recorded videos). In some cases, optional or supplemental readings may be listed for further study. The term Prep Work comes from kitchens and restaurants. It is the washing, cutting, pickling, station setting-up (mise en place), etc. that makes sure you’re ready to cook a dish. You do not want to be cutting onions or breaking down a chicken when the dinner rush begins and a large table places an order, and you do not want to save reviewing these materials until the last minute when you’re trying to complete the Participation Activities. Participation Activities (60 points) Participation activities are short tasks that introduce material and build specific skills. Points are earned by completing tasks each week, due by Friday at 5:00 pm (Central time). Each week will include a “menu” of participation activities for you to complete to earn up to 4 participation points per week. You do not need to complete all available activities, and you cannot earn more than 4 participation points per week. Participation activities may include commenting on readings, posting news or discussion questions to the class forum, reflecting on presented materials, and engaging in synchronous activities, such as attending Class Chats or participating in group learning activities. For those who are unable to attend synchronous class activities, there will be at least four asynchronous participation activity options each week that can be completed at any time. Given that there are 15 class weeks of the semester, you could earn as many as 60 points for participation (15 weeks x 4 points per week), although final grades are assigned assuming a course total of 50 participation + 50 Course Project = 100 total points. The extra 10 points are intended to serve as an “absence” buffer that you are invited to take (i.e. skip/miss entirely) for any reason or no reason at all. I try to have credit for participation activities posted to the Moodle grade book by the end of the following week. Next to each activity is a checkbox that you can use to keep track of which activities you’ve completed - this can be very handy in case I miscount your participation activities and you need to let me know which one(s) I might have missed. If you’ve started an activity but have not completed the objectives, I will message you with any additional work that would need to be done to earn credit. Asynchronous participation activities completed within a week of the original deadline (that is, by 5:00 pm of the next Friday) will be graded as usual. Synchronous participation activities cannot be made up at a later time. The regularly planned participation activities are intended to build knowledge from one week to the next. If at any time you find yourself unable to complete participation activities for an extended period of time, for any reason, please email me to arrange alternative assignments that will meet the course goals on a timeline that works for your situation. Some common examples of participation activities: Read &amp; Discuss articles via Perusall Most weeks will include the option to earn participation points by discussing one or more articles with your classmates through the Perusall social annotation platform. Perusall is free and can be accessed by following the article title link provided for each given activity, which should log you in under your Moodle/course identity automatically. The Perusall platform works best on a desktop, laptop, or tablet computer (it’s a bit buggy and jumbled on smartphones). The goals of these activities are to encourage drawing connections and asking questions. A recommended workflow would be: Read the whole article through once Go back over a second time to add your comments Note two ideas that you found thought-provoking or surprising Ask two questions about passages where you got lost Go back over a third time to respond to comments and questions made by your classmates I award a point for this activity as long as it’s clear that you’ve engaged meaningfully with the text. There is no absolute minimum for the number of annotations required to earn the participation point, but something like 4-6 comments/questions is usually reasonable. It would be possible to demonstrate having accomplished the goal of engaging with the whole text with just a single comment or question, but that would need to be one amazingly insightful comment or question. Class Chats In Weeks 1-4, 9, &amp; 10, we will meet for live interaction class time on Thursdays via Zoom. This intended to be an unstructured somewhat-lecture-style class meeting option where you will have the opportunity to ask questions and participate in informal group activities. Class Chats will be recorded and posted for later viewing/reference (although credit is only available for those who attend in real-time). Team Learning Projects Weeks 5-7 and 12 will be structured around completing Team Learning Projects. Team Learning Projects are an opportunity to work together to learn about and produce a summary of a topic of mutual interest among peers. All participation activities during these weeks (including asynchronous activities) will contribute to creating the Team Learning Project product, so you’ll work with your team even if you don’t attend the live Zoom sessions. You will have the option to complete structured tasks with your team via Zoom on Tuesday and Thursday in Weeks 5-7, and Thursday of Week 12. Teams will produce summaries of phenotypes in Weeks 5 and 7, a brief factsheet about a method in Week 6, and an infographic about a current (ethical) issue in Week 12. I’ll collect your preferences for team/topic assignments via a survey in Week 3. Not an actual class photo. Course Project (50 points) The course project is broken up into assignments throughout the semester that are intended to build-up to your final paper, including opportunities for both instructor and peer feedback. For more information, see the Course Project section. Throughout the course, you will develop expertise on a specific topic of your choosing. You may choose any topic related to the course content (behavior genetics), as long as I approve of it. You will produce a final paper of about 3,500 to 4,000 words (12 – 15 pages) for undergrads, or 4,000 to 4,500 words (15 – 18 pages) for grad students, plus references. I care more about clarity, insight, evidence, and the flow of argument than about length. Expect to read at least 10 – 20 published research papers on your topic of choice. For graduate students, plan to produce a paper that you could turn around and submit as a review in a decent journal or a book chapter. Course Project assignments are due by 5:00 pm (Central Time) on their listed due dates and are timed to allow for the sustained building of knowledge throughout the semester, taking into account the need for timely feedback. Please do your best to meet the given deadlines for course project assignments. Because the course project assignments are designed to build on one another sequentially, an assignment may be submitted and will be graded as usual (that is, no late penalty) until the next assignment deadline. This policy also applies to resubmissions (that is, if you are disappointed with your initial grade on a course project assignment, you may resubmit it up until the next assignment deadline). Late assignment submissions may not be circulated for peer feedback, and may not receive instructor feedback before the next assignment deadline. Course Policies This is an abbreviated list of policies that may be unique to this course. A fuller listing of general course policies is available to current students on the course website in Moodle. Land Acknowledgment I recognize and acknowledge that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is located on the lands of the Peoria, Kaskaskia, Piankashaw, Wea, Miami, Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and Chickasaw Nations. These lands were the traditional territory of these Native Nations prior to their forced removal; these lands continue to carry the stories of these Nations and their struggles for survival and identity. As a land-grant institution, the University of Illinois has a particular responsibility to acknowledge the peoples of these lands, as well as the histories of dispossession that have allowed for the growth of this institution for the past 150 years. We are also obligated to reflect on and actively address these histories and the role that this university has played in shaping them. This acknowledgment and the centering of Native peoples is a start as we move forward for the next 150 years. Accommodations The Disability Resources &amp; Educational Services office is available to facilitate the removal of barriers and ensure reasonable accommodations. You can share your letter of accommodation with the instructor by email. Participation Active participation in our online learning community is vital to making this course successful for everyone. You will be asked to engage in online discussions and other interactive learning environments that invite active participation and involvement with other students and your instructor. By registering for this online course, you commit to self-motivated study, participation in online course activities, and timely submission of assignments. Furthermore, you commit to accessing the course website and checking email at least four days per week. I expect that coursework will require approximately 9 hours per week, including preparing for and completing activities and assignments. If at any time you find yourself unable to commit 9 hours per week, or feel that activities and assignments are taking substantially more than that, please reach out to me. The quickest way is usually to make an appointment for a virtual one-on-one chat using my calendly sign-up. Deadlines Participation Activities are due by 5:00 pm (Central Time) in the week they are listed. Asynchronous participation activities completed within a week of the original deadline (that is, by 5:00 pm of the next Friday) will be graded as usual. Synchronous participation activities cannot be made up at a later time. The regularly planned participation activities are intended to build knowledge from one week to the next. If at any time you find yourself unable to complete participation activities for an extended period of time, for any reason, please email me to arrange alternative assignments that will meet the course goals on a timeline that works for your situation. Course Project assignments are due by 5:00 pm (Central Time) on their listed due dates and are timed to allow for the sustained building of knowledge throughout the semester, taking into account the need for timely feedback. Please do your best to meet the given deadlines for course project assignments.

"],["what-we-know-and-what-we-dont.html", "Week 1 What We Know and What We Don’t Objectives Lecture Notes Prep Work Participation Activities", " Week 1 What We Know and What We Don’t Behavior Genetics is a field that is defined by a common set of questions and methods, rather than being focused on any particular topic of study. This week we discuss some of the commonalities, or themes, that recur throughout research across topics, in terms of the questions we ask, what we know, and what we don’t (and maybe can’t) know. Objectives Introduce common terminology and themes in behavior genetics. Become comfortable with the typical weekly course structure. Evaluate and share what knowledge you come to this course with and what you hope to learn. Lecture Notes Hello and welcome to Week 1 of Psyc 408! Each week will begin with some (variably brief) notes by me, your instructor, about the topics, activities, and expectations for that week. This week, our major goal is to get oriented to the course (both in terms of –gesturing big– meta theoretic pedagogical conceptualization and, also, how to use the website). About Me I am a recently tenured (this summer, yay!) Associate Professor in the Psychology Department. Within Psychology, I’m formally part of the Social-Personality area. I do have a Ph.D., so my titles are either Dr. or Professor. However, Dr./Professor Derringer sounds like a supervillain, and now that you are taking my class we are friends, so you may call me Jaime. (Important note: for ALL of your instructors, default to Dr. or Professor until/unless they invite you to do otherwise; it costs you nothing and buys a lot of goodwill.) I went to undergrad at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh (go Steelers!), where I majored in Psychology and minored in Architecture (after dropping my major in Architecture due to a D in Physics and a Withdraw-Rather-Than-Fail in Freehand Drawing). As an undergrad I worked as a research assistant in an infant cognition lab where I learned that I loved research but would very much prefer to NOT work directly with participants - the babies weren’t so bad, but the parents… parents are a lot. I decided to go to grad school because by that point I had gotten pretty good at school in general and learned that Ph.D. programs for psychology (and many of the social/less-social sciences) finally start PAYING YOU to go to school. I had a general interest in serial killers so I googled “psychology grad school psychopathy” and found the person who would become my grad school advisor, Dr. Bob Krueger, at the University of Minnesota. (Actually, I found his advisor, Dr. Avshalom Caspi, first, but Avshalom was not taking grad students that year and recommended I look into his plucky former student. Plucky is my word, not his.) At the University of Minnesota, I was in the Personality, Individual differences, and Behavior genetics (PIB) area within their Psychology Department. Behavior genetics seemed interesting on paper, but I had never taken a genetics course (and, honestly, still haven’t - I tried to take one my last semester of undergrad but hadn’t taken the prerequisite of Organic Chemistry). Minnesota is home to one of the longest-running modern twin studies, and I spent my first two years working with their data (comparing twins - both identical and fraternal - is one of the most common, classic methods in human behavior genetics). Then, just at the point that I had completed my Master’s degree and was about to formally become a Doctoral Candidate, my advisor took a new job at Washington University in St. Louis and our whole lab up and moved. There was no behavior genetics area at WashU, so I had a choice to make: Clinical Psychology or Social-Personality. I chose Clinical because there are no jobs in Social-Personality. So I began, from scratch, clinical coursework and training to become a therapist. I saw clients and quickly realized that I. Am. Not. Cut. Out. To. Be. A. Therapist. But, happily, WashU had access to something that, at the time, Minnesota did not: genome-wide molecular genetic data. The Psychiatry department in their medical school houses a research group focused primarily on the genetics of addiction and I was fortunate to be able to begin working with them, and their incredibly rich data (which at the time was much more expensive than it is now, and so much harder to come by). I was bopping along happily learning all about molecular genetics when - boom - my advisor took a job BACK at Minnesota. Four years and two moves into my Ph.D., I found myself finishing my dissertation back in Minnesota, back in the PIB area (which suited me just fine, as I’m not sure I could have completed the 1-year clinical internship required to complete a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology). My dissertation was on the genetics of substance use, examining in BOTH the Minnesota population-representative twin sample AND the WashU clinically-ascertained sample whether (1) measures of substance use function similarly across general and clinical samples (they do), (2) general heritability of substance use changes with exposure to childhood maltreatment (maybe), and (3) the effects of certain specific genes are altered by exposure to childhood maltreatment (probably not, but the data at the time weren’t good enough to properly test this). Toward the end of my Ph.D., a relatively new method, the genome-wide association study (GWAS, pronounced “GEE-wahss”) was becoming more common. In a GWAS, rather than testing specific genes theoretically identified as potentially important for certain outcomes for association with or modification of the outcome, millions of individual variants from all across the genome are all tested for association with an outcome (literally: “Variant 1 correlated with the outcome? No. Variant 2 correlated with the outcome? No… Variant 2,000,042 correlated with the outcome?…”). At the same time, it was becoming clear that there are NO large-effect single-variant genetic effects on human behavioral outcomes - and (because of how our statistics work) if we wanted to find individual variants that were reliably and replicably correlated with human behavior, we were going to need HUGE sample sizes (like, 100,000 participants or don’t even bother). My advisor was contacted by a group of economists who were interested in putting together the first-ever 100,000+ person GWAS of a behavioral outcome, and he recommended me to serve as a primary data analyst. I pointed out to him that I had never done anything even close to that. His advice: “Say yes, and figure out how later.” I took a postdoctoral research position at the Institute for Behavioral Genetics at the University of Colorado - Boulder and spent the next two years doing GWAS. The outcome the economists wanted to look at was educational attainment: how many years of schooling you’ve attended and whether or not you graduated college. It’s “weakly heritable” (~10-20%) but it has one thing going for it - it’s a piece of data that’s collected in pretty much every study ever. At the time (this is way back in 2010), the largest GWAS datasets were mostly from medical studies and so had sparse behavioral data available. If we wanted to get to 100,000 participants, we had to work with what we had (at the time, GWAS data on a single participant cost ~$1000 - now it’s down to &lt;$50). Educational attainment is interesting to economists because it’s correlated with a Whole Bunch of Stuff - not necessarily causally, but that’s not always the goal. The psychologists on the project, myself included, didn’t think it would “work” (that is, find any associated genetic variants). Educational attainment is a “noisy” variable - a lot of things influence it, both systematically (personal, family, cultural characteristics) and randomly (luck, war, pandemics). But we figured the first truly large-scale behavioral GWAS was bound to get published somewhere decent, so might as well go along for the ride. We found 3 genetic variants associated with educational attainment, published the paper in Science, and that is the project that (arguably*) landed me this job. Rietveld, C. A., Medland, S. E., Derringer, J., Yang, J., Esko, T., Martin, N. W., … &amp; Albrecht, E. (2013). GWAS of 126,559 individuals identifies genetic variants associated with educational attainment. Science, 340(6139), 1467-1471. http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1235488 *My other area of research is measurement development and evaluation - it probably didn’t hurt my application for my job at UIUC as a Personality Psychologist that I helped develop the Personality Inventory for DSM-5, a continuous/non-categorical measure of personality disorder traits commissioned by the American Psychiatric Association and formally used in the DSM-5: Krueger, R. F., Derringer, J., Markon, K. E., Watson, D., &amp; Skodol, A. E. (2012). Initial construction of a maladaptive personality trait model and inventory for DSM-5. Psychological medicine, 42(9), 1879. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291711002674 What is Behavior Genetics? Behavior genetics is a field that is defined by a common set of methods which broadly attempt to answer two questions: Why do individuals differ from one another? and What causes someone to be who they are? These questions are related but can require very different approaches to address, and we will spend the semester discussing the approaches and limitations of our attempts to understand the answers to both of them. Like any field, behavior genetics commonly uses a unique set of terms that is quite inscrutable to outsiders. Some that will come up CONSTANTLY throughout the semester: Phenotype: This is any outcome that we are interested in. It can be a behavior, a physical characteristic, a low-level biological function, literally (almost) anything - except for the genotype itself. Genotype: The sequence of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts that make (or rather, represent) the rungs on the ladder of everyone’s DNA (humans and non-humans alike). Environment: Everything that is not the genotype. This can be what we usually think of when we hear the word environment (family, culture), it can be your experiences, personal traits, it can even be biological environments, like hormones and what you’ve had to eat today, or ever. (Note: the difference between a “phenotype” and an “environment” is in the eye of the beholder - phenotypes can be environments and vice versa.) Why do we use jargon? Well, it makes us sound fancy and, as with all language, it provides shortcuts to understanding that save time once you’re familiar with it. But in behavior genetics, we have another layer of communication to contend with: historical context. Behavior genetics, as a field, is inextricably linked with eugenics (the “father” of behavior genetics, Francis Galton, coined the term eugenics and most of the prominent early scientists in the field were avid advocates). Jargon makes our papers hard to read, and when they are hard to read, fewer people will read them, and we (the scientists) spend less time having to publicly contend with that historical (and, honestly, present) context. We’ll talk more about eugenics and the real-world applications of behavior genetics (both good and evil - but, on balance, mostly evil) in the coming weeks. So, we have a whole field of defensive scientists writing dense papers, either on purpose or (for the same reason MOST academic writing is dense and boring) because we’re not trained to write well. That’s fine if there’s nothing terribly interesting or practically important in those papers. But the reality is this information, and how we arrive at it, is becoming critically more important all the time as technology advances and the potential applications expand. In the past few years, we’ve seen a rapid decline in the cost of genotyping, combined with an incredible explosion in the development of new technologies. Genetic information is used in reproductive decision making (from pre-conception genetic counseling to embryo selection to prenatal and neonatal screening), diagnosis and prediction of disease and non-disease phenotypes (in medical and non-medical settings, including direct-to-consumer genotyping services), and criminal proceedings (identification of individuals and, occasionally, determining responsibility). I keep seeing a sponsored tweet advertising a service to tell me what I should eat based on my DNA. I have one goal for this course: Scientific Literacy. In life, and soon if not already, you are going to be asked to make decisions and buy services based on the research we talk about in this class. I want you to be an educated consumer. There are no course prerequisites for Psyc 408, but there is a personal one: you need to be interested in the journey we are about to embark on. This material is not easy, but motivation will take you as far as you need to go. If you’ve made it this far, and you’ve browsed the course website, and you are still thinking “this sounds interesting!”: you are ready to go. Themes in Behavior Genetics Although there is essentially an infinite number of phenotypes that a person might be interested in, as a field organized around a common set of methods we’ve noticed over the years that, regardless of the phenotype, some consistencies tend to emerge, in both basic findings and new questions/theories that emerge. In this course, we will refer to these as Themes in Behavior Genetics, and we will use these Themes to organize the many topics (and many, MANY readings and other source materials) that we will cover. These themes are drawn from: Plomin, R., DeFries, J. C., Knopik, V. S., &amp; Neiderhiser, J. M. (2016). Top 10 replicated findings from behavioral genetics. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 11(1), 3-23. https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691615617439 Briley, D. A., Livengood, J., Derringer, J., Tucker-Drob, E. M., Fraley, R. C., &amp; Roberts, B. W. (2019). Interpreting behavior genetic models: seven developmental processes to understand. Behavior Genetics, 49(2), 196-210. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10519-018-9939-6 These happen to be this week’s options for the Read &amp; Discuss via Perusall participation activities - they go into more detail about how we’ve arrived at or current thinking about each of the following themes. We will refer to these extensively throughout the semester, so keep this list (and the readings, for more details) handy. Everything is at least a little bit heritable (that is, more closely genetically related individuals are more similar phenotypically) Nothing is 100% heritable (even identical twins are a little different from one another on anything we can measure) Heritability is caused by many genes of small effect (there is no “gene for” in psychology, human behavior, or indeed ANY trait that commonly varies between people) Correlations between phenotypes are partly due to correlated genetic/heritable influences Heritability increases through development (at least through middle adulthood) Trait stability or consistency across time within an individual is due to stable genetic influences Even things we think of as “the environment” show non-zero heritability (example: divorce) Correlations between phenotypes and environments are partly due to correlated genetic/heritable influences Most environments are not shared between people, even siblings or twins raised together Abnormal is normal (influences on extremes that we label as “disorders” versus normal-range traits are not different in kind, just amount) Phenotypes (means, variances, and presentations) change over development - we cannot use the same measures or interpretations without knowing the developmental context Most behavior genetic research necessarily assumes (because of data limitations) that genetic and environmental influences are independent (that is, uncorrelated) Mating is non-random (although random mating is an assumption of many of our models, again because of data limitations) The development of an individual is not necessarily the same as the average developmental course Gene-environment correlation (rGE) exists and, if not accounted for, causes biases in our estimation of heritability and genetic effects Gene-environment interaction (GxE) potentially explains why people exposed to the same environments respond differently None of these influences exist in a vacuum: simultaneous gene-environment interplay (rGE &amp; GxE) is almost certainly happening all the time, to all of us, in parallel, in sequence, reciprocally. The True Model (if such a thing exists) is almost certainly more complex than we could ever gather data for and test. It is not my expectation that you memorize or understand these this first week. The goal now is awareness - these themes will pop up over and over again, throughout the course, across topics both in class and in your paper. Keep them handy as a reference, and know that you’re going to learn so much about all of them by the end of the semester. Prep Work Below is a list of materials to review early in the week.

"],["weve-been-wrong-before.html", "Week 2 We’ve Been Wrong Before Objectives Lecture Notes Prep Work Participation Activities", " Week 2 We’ve Been Wrong Before Behavior genetics is perhaps best known for our spectacular failures, both in terms of venturing into public policy (eugenics) and producing a popular treasure trove of false-positive results (classic candidate gene studies) that are, unfortunately, the only BG research most people have ever heard of. So this is the “history of the field” week. Objectives Become familiar with the history of eugenic programs in the US and worldwide Understand the history, methods, and limitations of candidate gene studies Lecture Notes A Very Brief History of Eugenics In 1883, Frances Galton, who is considered the father of modern behavior genetics and happened to be Charles Darwin’s cousin, coined the term “eugenics,” meaning, from the Greek terms eu- and genos, “good genes.” The early proposals for advancing eugenics was through government incentives (essentially, paying) for “eminent” people to marry and have children. Galton defined eminence as being rich (coming from rich families), educated (certainly not universally available), and having an eminent profession (like a doctor, judge, scientist - again, not options that were equally available to everyone). The past and present of human behavior genetics is inextricably linked with the history of eugenics, not only because behavior genetics has been used to justify eugenic policies, which have overwhelmingly been abusive and violent, and targeted primarily at racial/ethnic/religious minorities, women, and people with disabilities. The reality is that the men and women who advocated for eugenic policies developed the methods that we still use today, often with the express purpose of producing data and statistics to support their advocacy. We cannot simply stop using their methods – not just within behavior genetics, but across the sciences overall: Karl Pearson, who developed the correlation (Pearson correlation), was Galton’s protege (Wikipedia’s word) and developed the correlation statistic to formally quantify Galton’s observation that parents and children tended to be similar on “eminence,” which he took as necessarily indicative of biological transmission. We cannot simply erase these men from our history or our science, so we need to acknowledge the bad with the good, and use knowledge of the past to consider how we can do better now and in the future. When most people think of eugenics, they think of the Nazis. In the lead up to and during World War II, the Nazis enacted policies ranging from propaganda encouraging folks to be aware of family history of mental or physical illness when deciding who to marry and have children with, to enacting laws forbidding whites from marrying non-whites, making abortion illegal for women deemed to be ‘fit’ (of good, presumably genetic, quality), and registration of disabilities and illnesses leading to the forced surgical sterilization of over 400,000 people. And this is all in addition to the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews and millions of other people from marginalized groups, including the disabled, the Romani, and people suspected of being gay. What is less often discussed is that many of these policies, including forced sterilization, were in fact based on existing US policies. And the Nazi versions of the US policies were not necessarily more severe or violent. For example, the US laws forbidding interracial marriage defined “white” much more strictly. Racial and ethnic identification in the US has typically followed “the one-drop rule”: one-drop of non-white blood (or, any evidence of non-white heritage) excluded a person from the “white” demographic category. The US was the first place in which eugenic sterilization policies were put into place. Around the turn of the 1900s, several states had legislation move increasingly further until in 1907 the first policies were enacted in Indiana. In 1927, the US Supreme Court upheld (8-1) Virginia’s eugenic sterilization policy in the case of Buck v Bell. Immediately, similar policies spread quickly across the US. Non-eugenic sterilization exists, as well. Therapeutic sterilization typically refers to cases where women with extremely painful periods or uncomfortable or potentially cancerous tumors choose to have those organs removed or cases where people choose surgical interventions (tubal ligation or vasectomies) to voluntarily, with full informed consent, serve as a form of permanent birth control. Punitive sterilization is typically non-surgical (e.g. “chemical castration”) and used as a condition of release for repeat sex offenders. Eugenic sterilization, however, is specifically targeted a controlling the reproduction of others, regardless of their consent, with the goal of reducing the rates of mental and physical disabilities in the population. In the US, over the course of the six or so decades that eugenic sterilization policies were in place in the US, over 60,000 people were forcibly sterilized. Overwhelmingly, the people targeted by the state-directed eugenics boards that made such decisions were women or girls, especially those who were poor or Black. After World War II and the widespread revelation of the Nazi’s atrocities, public opinion of eugenic sterilization declined. But these policies didn’t simply disappear – the last eugenic sterilization in the US occurred in Oregon in 1981. 1981. That is not a typo. 1981. This is not ancient history. Many of the victims of these policies are still alive. In the Prep Work for this week, you’ll hear members of these state eugenics boards discussing how they made these decisions. You’ll meet a woman who was sterilized by a eugenics board as a child after she became pregnant from a rape. And you’ll meet her son, who was born by c-section at the same time that she was surgically sterilized. The state that did this to her, North Carolina, has committed $10 million in compensation for victims of its eugenics program. Even if all 7,600 people sterilized by that state were alive and able to claim their share, that comes out to $1,315 per person. Candidate Genes A cautionary tale of doing what we can with the technology available at the time In more recent decades, the (intentional, widespread) involvement of behavior genetics researchers in public policy has been substantially reduced. Nonetheless, research from within the field tends to still gain widespread attention - the search for biological bases of behavior, genetic or otherwise, continues to hold our fascination worldwide. In the late 20th century, the development of novel technologies allowed us to partially read small parts of the genome (to describe this process broadly, we tend to use the word “genotype” as a verb, as shorthand for “to read the genotype”). Example image of PCR gel electrophoresis showing several columns with variable distributions of horizontal black bands In the olden days, we weren’t able to obtain full genome reads, however. Genotyping required targeting specific sequences within the DNA, cutting them away from the rest of the surrounding DNA, and investigating them intentionally. Similar techniques can be used for a variety of applications in genetic research and application (including cutting DNA into small bits, running them across an electrophoresis gel, and comparing the results across two individuals, say a suspect and DNA found at a crime scene - a process you’ve likely seen depicted in countless crime dramas). In behavior genetics, our application of this technology took the form of candidate gene research - if we knew in advance what gene (or, even more specifically, which variant within a gene) we wanted to study, we could cut out just that part, amplify it, and determine the genotype at that targeted location. The classic candidate genes are the variants that you’re most likely to have heard are associated with human behavior. 5-HTT-LPR, MAOA-uVNTR, COMT-Val158Met, DRD4-7R all emerged as major candidate genes for human behavior in the 1990s and 2000s. The term candidate gene, however, is a pretty serious misnomer. Genes are huge, complicated things, with many sections that can be read in many variable ways (this is how your same DNA in every cell of your body can create so many different tissues and organs - the genotype is unchanged, but how it is read differs across tissue types). And even their “thing”-ness is questionable; debates around how to define “a gene” are still very much around, as we develop our understanding of the variable reads (including alternative start-stop locations, meaning that genes are not only next to each other but can also overlap), effects of regulatory elements upstream and sometimes downstream of the genes, and the role of intronic elements (the non-coding parts of the genes, in contrast with the coding exonic regions). Candidate genes would be more accurately called candidate VARIANTS. The term “candidate gene” seldom refers to an entire gene; rather, it typically refers to the targeted investigation of a single variant (from potentially hundreds) within a gene. (The specification or label of exactly which variant within the whole gene is what is labeled after the “-” in my gene list at the start of this paragraph.) So, how did we choose which genes and which variants to go after? The genes were relatively easy to compile a shortlist of. We looked to non-human animal research, which had been investigating the consequences of removing an entire gene from model organisms, like mice, fruit flies, and worms. Luckily, much of the genome is conserved across species during evolution. That is, most of our DNA isn’t working at making us specifically human or specifically ourselves, it’s just trying to keep the basic functions of life going (breathing, eating, making sure our cells stick together). As a result, we share many genes (and biological systems) with other species, so when we find a gene that, say, substantially alters how dopamine is processed, and we know from dopamine administration trials in humans and non-humans that dopamine changes behavior (including things like risk-taking) we might be optimistic that the particular gene identified in the model organisms would be an interesting target within humans. Picking the specific variant within a given gene was more tricky, especially in the late 20th century when model organism research (and technology) was largely limited to targeting the removal of whole genes (or even multi-gene segments). In genotyping, a whole gene was too much, especially if we wanted to characterize naturally occurring variation among individuals (not just gene presence versus gene absence). You might think that the variants within genes (your -LPRs, -uVNTRs, -Val158Mets, -7Rs, etc.) were selected because they were known to have the greatest impact on gene function (or even organism behavior). The reality is much more mundane and practical. Specific variants were chosen within these candidate genes for one primary reason - they were relatively easy to genotype. DNA has a physical structure, with turns and folds and repetitions that make certain parts harder to physically access than others. For the most part, what we refer to as candidate genes were selected because they were one of the hundreds of potential variants within large genes of overall consequence (that is, you don’t want to be missing it entirely) that could be pretty easily genotyped in a lab by someone with relatively little training. In many cases, it was because the variant regions were large - most of the variants targeted by candidate gene studies are what’s known as a variable number of tandem repeat regions (VNTRs), which means a short sequence of As, Cs, Ts, and/or Gs repeats a variable number of times (as is the case for the 5-HTT-LPR, where LPR stands for Limited Polymorphism Repeat (polymorphism meaning “many forms”; for MAOA-uVNTR, where that lower case u is how we lazily type lower case greek letter “mu”, identifying the specific VNTR we’re talking about; and DRD4-7R, referring to the 7 Repeat version of a VNTR that can commonly have both more or less than 7 repeats, but the 7R form is what’s been proposed for an increased likelihood of ADHD-like traits). So, big stuff is easy to see/genotype, and it was all we could do at the time, better than nothing, right? This week you’ll read in the Slate Star Codex (2019) blog post and the Keller &amp; Duncan (2011) paper about the history of 5-HTT-LPR research and how we wasted immense money, time, and public attention chasing and defending false positives. I also want to give you some specific background on MAOA-uVNTR (“the warrior gene”), whose story runs very much parallel to 5-HTT-LPR, but happens to be the first gene that I ever personally published on, and so is, as a cautionary tale, quite near and dear to my heart. And for that reason, and because I’ve gone on quite long enough here, dear reader, I’ll be covering the story of my own now-presumed-false-positive MAOA finding in the Class Chat this week.

List of candidate genes to look for: 5-HT2A; 5-HTT; AVPR1A; BDNF; CHRM2; COMT; DAT1; DISC1; DRD2; DRD3; DRD4; GABRA2; MAOA; OXTR Hint 1: Restrict search results to articles published in/since 2017. Once you’ve started your search from the Google Scholar homepage, there will be a link in the top left of the results page that says “Since 2017”. Click it. Hint 2: Look for an empirical article; that is, one that does an analysis of data (rather than a review article, which only summarizes previous studies). An Empirical article will have a Methods section giving the number of participants, what measures were used (for both phenotypes and genotypes), and a description of how the data were analyzed. Hint 3: To get the APA-formatted citation for a paper, click on the quotation mark icon below its listing in the search results. Hint 4: To view papers that have cited your target paper (as replications usually should), click on the “Cited by ##” link below the paper’s search result listing. Hint 5: To access a copy of the paper, click on the title, or any link in the right-side column of the search result listing, or the link below the search result listing that says “All ## versions” (which will bring up all links that google scholar has found associated with that same article). Make good choices about clicking on links. You shouldn’t have to pay to access any of these articles. If you hit a paywall, try either (1) being on campus (university subscriptions are often triggered automatically by your IP address), or (2) pretend you’re on campus by signing into VPN, or (3) search for the article through the campus library system. I definitely wouldn’t recommend that you familiarize yourself with the Sci-Hub system (wiki article here), which breaks paywalls to make pretty much every scholarly article available to everyone for free. It’s illegal enough that it has to move server hosts frequently. To make sure you don’t end up there accidentally, definitely don’t search “where is sci-hub now”. Totally unrelated, if you want an article that you can’t get free access to, just let me know and I’ll find you a copy. Article charges go to the publishers, who don’t pay authors or reviewers. If you ever in the future want an article that you can’t get access to, a great option is to email the author to ask for a copy - we love to share because it means someone’s interested in our work, and it doesn’t cost us anything to email a pdf. Caveat: A point will only be awarded to the first person to post any given paper, so check what’s already been posted before starting on your own. Class Chat on Thursday, 11:00 am - 12:20 pm (CT) "],["ancestry-and-scientific-racism.html", "Week 3 Ancestry and Scientific Racism Objectives Lecture Notes Prep Work Participation Activities", " Week 3 Ancestry and Scientific Racism This week we discuss population genetics and how the statistical construct that we refer to as ancestry differs from the concepts of racial/cultural identity and the social construct of race. Objectives Learn how semi-random patterns of mutation and inheritance, often within DNA regions of little to no functional consequence, give rise to the statistical concept of ancestry. Understand the differences between the concepts of ancestry, identity, and race. Introduce how wrong conclusions arise when ancestry, identity, and race are conflated in science research or communication. Lecture Notes These notes are intended to be a good enough introduction to a very complex process (population genetics), which is enough to build an entire course around (at UIUC: ANSC 446 / IB 416). For more details right now, I recommend Dr. Graham Coop’s lecture notes: https://cooplab.github.io/popgen-notes/ Population Genetics &amp; Ancestry Two processes increase genetic diversity within a population. Mutation introduces novel variants into the population. Recombination re-shuffles the existing patterns of variation (what we call haplotypes). Both of these processes take place in every individual in every generation. Each of us carries hundreds of de novo (or new) mutations that we did not inherit from either of our parents. And each of us typically carries chromosomes that were not inherited intact from our parents, but instead, such as through a cross-over event, were newly formed from chromosomes that had been separated in our genetic parents. The fate of new mutations is affected by random drift, selection, and population history. Although many think of selection as being the most powerful force acting on new mutations, whether positive (increasing the frequency of the mutation in the population over generations) or negative (decreasing the frequency of the mutation in the population over generations), selection can only occur if the mutation has a consistent impact on an outcome that changes reproductive success (that is, something to be selected for or against). The vast majority of mutations have no or negligible impact on anything (this must be true, otherwise those hundreds of new mutations we all carry would quickly make us so different we wouldn’t be able to successfully reproduce at all). As a result, most mutations are neither selected for nor against. Sometimes, they may be located physically close on the ladder of DNA to a functionally important variant, so even mutations with no impact may still systematically increase or decrease in frequency along with that nearby functional or causal variant. But, absent this close physical link to a causal variation, nonfunctional mutations may persist, increase, or decrease in frequency over time largely as a function of randomness. The extent to which any mutations that are physically close to one another on the ladder of DNA are expected to remain linked, or correlated, across generations is referred to as linkage disequilibrium (LD). Without the process of recombination, this LD would never be broken down and would extend a great distance along chromosomes. If Person 1 had Mutation A and Mutation B appear de novo on the same chromosome, and there was no recombination, all of Person 1s descendants would always carry both Mutation A and Mutation B. That is, the mutations would remain perfectly correlated or in strong LD; if we knew someone was a carrier of Mutation A, we would also know they were a carrier of Mutation B, even without genotyping them at the location of Mutation B. Recombination breaks down the correlation between mutations or variants over many successive generations, leaving a narrower window of correlation, or LD, over generations. For an illustration of how LD between mutations breaks down over generations, see: https://cjbattey.shinyapps.io/LDsim/ It just so happens that mutation and recombination happen at fairly predictable rates, and so we can simulate how far patterns of LD should extend across the genome if only those two processes were at play and they played out fairly neutrally. When we compare that to the observed pattern of LD (see Figure below), we consistently observe that LD is stronger for longer distances of the genome than would be expected by chance alone. That suggests that one or more key assumptions (including neutral evolution - that is, no directional selection, homogeneous recombination - or recombination rates only being due to distance between mutations, and random mating) likely do not hold in the population we are examining (in this course, humans; but the same patterns is observed across species). Under certain assumptions (neutral evolution, random mating, homogeneous recombination), we can model exactly how far this correlation should extend. Observed patterns of linkage disequilibrium are more expansive than would be predicted under these assumptions (image from https://doi.org/10.1038/35075590). In human research, we usually don’t focus as much on heterogeneous recombination or directional selection. Selection can really only be observed across generations, so isn’t feasible for human researchers studying human participants (for this, we look to non-human animal research on organisms with shorter generations. Heterogeneous recombination is often attributable to physical characteristics of DNA (so generally stuff that’s outside the focus of this course), such as the density of packing and folding structures that affect how likely any given segments of DNA are to get tangled. But it is important; very briefly, really important stuff - like the MHC, a gene-rich region on chromosome 6 that basically builds the immune system - are packed really tightly to avoid mutation and recombination, because it works well enough and messing up those core regions with random changes could be really bad, like non-viable-organism bad. More relevant to how we think about LD in this course is the pattern of non-random mating. Although disassortative mating does occur (selection of reproductive partners based on having different characteristics; most notably in sexually reproducing species: different available sex cells), assortative mating (or reproducing with partners who are similar to ourselves) is a common process that plays out across generations and cultures, for both behavioral and non-behavioral characteristics. We typically classify assortative mating under three processes. In primary assortative mating, mates choose each other intentionally based on their trait similarity (for example, “I play soccer, I want to raise my children as soccer players, I will only consider partnering with someone else who plays soccer”). Under social homogamy, mates choose each other due to proximity that happens because they have self-selected or have been selected into environmental proximity (“I might consider a non-soccer-playing partner, but I play and talk about soccer so much that I only ever meet other soccer players”). Under convergence, mates become more similar to each other over time (“At first I played soccer and my partner didn’t, but now I’ve taught them to play soccer.”) We tend to observe assortative mating across three broad domains: attractiveness (including height), moral attitudes (including religious and political attitudes), and cognitive ability (including educational attainment). For any of these domains (except the VERY SPECIFIC example of height), any one or more of the primary, homogamy, and convergence processes could be influencing the observed outcome of partners being more similar on the phenotype than expected by chance alone (again, except we do know that convergence can not explain why people tend to end up with similar-height others). We also know that assortative mating does not occur for certain other domains, including personality and mental health (the average correlation between partners on these phenotypes tends to be 0 - partners aren’t likely to be systematically either similar or dissimilar to one another.) But, beyond the individual differences that we tend to focus on when examining whether partners are more or less similar to one another is a factor that I know, for the overwhelming majority of all human mates (or, even beyond that, all mating pairs across all sexually reproducing species), is a similarity in their location in place and time. Until the relatively recent developments of long-distance travel and assisted reproductive technology (such as sperm and egg donation), our genetic ancestors were limited in mating options by one criterion first and foremost - were we in the same place, at the same time? (After that, of course, the options could be narrowed down further; but same time + same place was the first criterion that applied to everyone.) Throughout the overwhelming majority of the history of our species, our ability to travel has been limited and slow. So most humans were born and died in the same general geographic location as their ancestors going back hundreds or thousands of years. With limited movement across many generations, who do you end up mating with? Well, you don’t get to choose from the entirety of the human population; you’re limited to those around you, who have also been in the same place as their ancestors for a long time, over many generations mating only with people in the same place - there’s a pretty good chance that your reproductive options were limited to people who were your relatively close cousins. Not necessarily your first cousins (although that is the route Charles Darwin took) but, commonly, people within a region or village would all end up being, genetically speaking, the equivalent of 3rd or 4th cousins. So, you’re not mating with your 50th cousins, who are the humans on the other side of the globe, but with your relatively close genetic cousins. And the more closely related two people are, the more likely it is that they inherited some of those de novo mutations that popped up a few generations back in the same person/ancestor. And so the pattern of LD that we observe is stronger than expected - because we aren’t recombining all available mutations across the entire population, we’re limited to what exists in the surrounding area. And that process of essentially assortative mating for time and place leads to even neutral, nonfunctional mutations being shared more than expected by chance by people who are from the same genetic and, usually throughout history, social family tree. This non-random genetic similarity is the single largest signature in our genome when we look at the &lt;99% of DNA that differs between people, and it’s what we label “ancestry.” Principal Components Analysis The way we estimate ancestry in human genomics is often using a statistical procedure (not specific to genetics) called principal components analysis (PCA). PCA is applied to genotype data to describe continuous axes, or principal components (PCs), of genetic variation. The variables that emerge attempt to simplify a whole dataset of hundreds or thousands of participants, genotyped on thousands or millions of loci, into just a few variables (usually 20 - 100 components) that summarize how similar, or geometrically close, each participant is to each other participant. Each component “explains” as much of the genetic variation as possible, after accounting for the preceding components (so what we label PC1 summarizes the largest amount of genetic variation among the participants within the analyzed dataset, PC2 summarizes the next largest amount, and so on through however many PCs we’ve elected to estimate). PCs are used as covariates in analyses to attempt to statistically control for the non-random differences in mutations and LD between people. We take these PCs to have something to do with historical patterns of reproduction for two reasons. First, because theory suggests that these patterns (arising from the random mutations, plus nonrandom patterns of mating primarily for same-place-same-time) will be the largest effects observed in the human genome because selection/evolution is SLOW (requiring tens or hundreds of generations) compared to how quickly mutations are generated and passed down (every generation). Second, because when we’ve estimated these PCs for participants who are from locations where their ancestors have lived for hundreds or thousands of years, the PCs broadly map onto geographic variation. Below is one of the most well-known Figures in population genetics, from a paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07331) demonstrating that the first two PCs estimated from genomes from European participants (each represented by a dot, color-coded based on the place the person lived, restricted to folks who identified all four grandparents as being from that same place) essentially recreates the East/West and North/South gradients when shown on top of a map of Europe. This pattern, where genetic mutations track geographic locations has been shown over and over across the world, wherever there is a substantial population that has been relatively stationary for hundreds or thousands of years. Genomic ancestry patterns don’t just track geographic limitations on patterns of mating, however. If, for example, there exists a religion that for hundreds or thousands of years encourages its adherents to marry with other members of the same religion, you end up with similar patterns of distinguishing mutations popping up and being passed down within that lineage; this is how we can estimate genetic signatures of certain religious or cultural groups. One example of genomic transmission running in parallel to cultural transmission resulting in culturally identified PCs is among Ashkenazi Jews. Because of a long-running cultural emphasis on within-religion marriage, if you are of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage (which I am), you and I are likely the genetic equivalent of third or fourth cousins, even if our social genealogies would not identify a specific common ancestor that recently (within the past 4 or 5 generations). It does NOT mean, however, that the ancestry-informative markers that the PCA process uses to cluster us together as genetically similar have any impact on our traits, and it certainly doesn’t mean that there are any genes that make us Jewish. As an example, Judaism is traditionally considered to be transmitted through the mother’s line, but I am only “genetically Jewish” on my father’s side; following our culture’s traditional rules, I am considered Jewish because my Scandinavian-ancestry mother converted to Judaism before I was born; personally, I identify as Jewish because I was raised in the traditions, had a bat mitzvah (I had a moon bounce at my party!), and care deeply about bagels and deli (the Jewish side of my family is from Hoboken, New Jersey - so place and culture are both confounded with ancestry for me). Genomic ancestry does not tell us about identity or experience - it is simply a statistical signal that arises from who your genetic ancestors were (and even then, not all of them; the way probability works - you only get 50% of DNA from each genetic parent - means that many of your ancestors, especially several generations back, may not be directly represented in your DNA at all). Unfortunately for our ability to figure out “what genes do”, genes are constantly, for most people throughout most of human history, passed down within families in a very similar pattern to how culture, or environmental exposures, or resource availability may track over time. And these spurious associations between background ancestry and environmental outcomes can arise even over a short period of time. For example, suppose it were suddenly decreed that all Icelanders must wear tophats. The policy takes effect on Jan 1. On Jan 2, you collect data from all over the world on tophat-wearing, along with DNA. You would find that the mutations that happen to appear among Icelanders more than among other ancestries are strongly correlated with tophat-wearing. But if you ‘controlled for’ (Icelandic and other) ancestry by including principal components as covariates in your statistical analysis, those correlations between genetic variants and tophat-wearing would disappear. The problem is because these spurious correlations between ancestry and environment can occur quickly, it means that to fully account for them we must be certain that we are accounting for even relatively recent (that is, single generation) passing of novel mutations. Practically speaking, we cannot collect enough data (either in quantity or detail) from among putatively unrelated folks to estimated ancestry at this necessary level of detail. For this, we must use what is currently considered the gold standard for statistical control for background ancestry, which is to examine effects only among participants from the same family (that is, siblings). Because it is much more difficult to collect family data than to just include all available participants, most studies seeking to identify genetic associations with any phenotype are still subject to the potential confounding effect of ancestry - it is incredibly difficult to rule out parallel environmental effects as an explanation (that is, this is a form of gene-environment correlation). The Figures below show a real-world example of what happens when you fail to account for genomic ancestry in a situation where the outcome is confounded (or correlated for artificial, not causal, reasons) with genomic ancestry. The Figure below this paragraph illustrates an analysis looking for genetic variants associated with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) (https://doi.org/10.1038/nature10251). However, the available sample was not a random or representative sample (it never is). Panel A shows the number of cases (folks with MS, in red text) and controls (folks without MS, in black text) included in the study broken down by each country of origin. As you can see, the numbers aren’t similar proportions from each country: some contributed only cases, while others contributed substantially more controls than cases. Panel B shows the plot of the first two principal components for all the participants (1) split by case-control status and (2) color-coded by country of origin. As you can see, (1) the countries differ in terms of their average PCs (participants labeled with the same color tend to cluster together), and (2) the distribution of colors (representing countries) differs between the case and control groups. This sampling scheme has created a confound - or an unintended nuisance correlation - between ancestry and MS case-control status. The Figure below this paragraph shows one of the common ways (called a ‘Q-Q plot’) that we summarize the results of the millions of tests that are done in a genome-wide association study (GWAS, pronounced “gee-WAHs”), when we check each available genotyped single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, pronounced “snip”) for correlation with a phenotype of interest. When so many tests are done, there will be some very low p-values (how we tend to evaluate statistical significance) by chance alone. To take that into account, we can compare our observed distribution of p-values (the values used to array points - which each of which represents the result of one tested SNP - along the vertical y-axis) to the distribution of p-values that would be expected by chance alone (that’s the values used to array points along the horizontal x-axis). The dotted black line running along the diagonal is where we would expect the points to fall if there were no effects (that is, if the observed distribution and the expected distribution were the same). Points falling above the line indicate more SNPs with lower p-values than would be expected by chance alone. The plot to the left, labeled ‘No correction’, shows the result of the GWAS of MS when the PCs are NOT included as a covariate. That is, it looks like ALL the SNPs have lower p-values than expected by chance, and so we might conclude that ALL the SNPs are associated with MS. This divergence is summarized by the lambda coefficient: here it’s 2.5, which is HUGE. Once the top 100 PCs are included as covariates (the results shown in the right-side plot), however, it drops to 1.221 (values closer to 1 are considered less likely to reflect substantial stratification). There are still a lot of SNPs more strongly associated with MS than would be expected by chance alone (MS is heritable and polygenic - many genes, not just one), but there’s also some SNPs (densely plotted in that bottom left corner, it’s actually MOST of the SNPs) that are unrelated to MS status. Ancestry and Scientific Racism The subtleties that arise from the often co-occurrence of genetic transmission and exposure to experiences are subtle yet pervasive. Realistically, most people are not super excited about understanding the technical limitations and interpretations of this genetic ancestry thing. It is easy to misunderstand or to intentionally misrepresent, and the consequences of such can be dire, either in terms of encouraging folks to wrongly conclude that there are substantial genetic differences between geographic, cultural, or ethnic groups; that groupings we perceive or enact are “real” or distinct (we never observe categorical grouping among participants; genetic distribution is a continuous swath that stretches across all of humanity at as fine-grained a level of measurement as we can undertake); or that associations between genes and behavior (or other traits) necessarily mean that genes are the cause of the outcome. We often assume that genetic associations must be causal (even though by association I mean correlation and correlations are not sufficient to prove causation) because genes came first. But, for most of us, our genes didn’t come first, or come together randomly - they came from our social parents, who provide both genes and environments, and who did not end up mixing their genetic material randomly. And for that reason, observing that a genetic variant is associated with a phenotype in a general population sample is only the first step to understanding how or why that association has occurred - and it’s absolutely not necessarily because the gene is the cause.

Objectives Understand the logic and common applications of twin studies and GWAS. Become familiar with standard formats of tables, graphs, and statistics commonly used in twin studies and GWAS. Lecture Notes Behavior genetics as a field is defined by the use of a common set of methods, usually based on the availability of genetically informative data, whether organized into known relative groups or having available genotype data or both. Because of this strong overlap in methods, once you understand the general properties of a method (what it tests, how we report results, what you can- or can’t- learn from it) you can begin to dive into the literature on any phenotype. This week we will focus on what are probably the two most common current methods: The Classical Twin Study, where we estimate the similarity (correlation) between identical twins, and the correlation between fraternal twins, on some phenotype of interest and draw conclusions on the basis of how those two correlations compare; and The Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS, pronounced GEE-wah-ss), where we one-at-a-time test the correlation between each of millions of individual genetic variants with some phenotype of interest. Both of these are rather broad analyses, involving a lot of simplification and resting on many assumptions. We tend to use both as a “first step” in understanding the genetics of a phenotype, and both can serve as a basis of or launching point for more niche, complex analyses that we’ll begin covering in-depth in Week 6. Finding Behavior Genetic Papers I personally prefer Google Scholar for searching for scholarly literature. Because behavior genetics is defined by a common set of methods, if you’re looking for material related to a particular phenotype, some combination of that phenotype name and a method or two will usually turn up the bulk of the relevant literature - for example, try starting with [phenotype] heritability and [phenotype] genetics, or specific concept/method names, like [phenotype] GWAS or [phenotype] “twin study”. As you find papers that seem relevant, keep track of synonyms that appear for your phenotype, method, or concept - many topics go by a handful of different terms depending on the particular research lab or subfield that they originate from. When you find a paper you like or that is particularly helpful, try looking at the papers that cite it, the papers that it cites, or for other research by the same author(s). I also quite like the CoCites tool by Dr. Cecile Janssens, a Chrome extension that identifies papers that tend to be cited alongside a given paper that you’ve found in either Google Scholar or PubMed. Human behavior genetics is a field that sometimes moves quite rapidly in terms of technological and statistical developments, so papers that are more recent or have larger sample sizes/numbers of participants are generally assumed to be of higher quality or more reliable. But that doesn’t mean that smaller or older studies are not of value. It is important to evaluate any paper holistically, but especially in terms of its methods. Because genetically informative data are expensive (both in terms of the actual cost, as well as time investment), secondary data analysis (or re-analysis) of data is incredibly common. It is hugely likely that the data used for a particular paper of interest for you was not designed or collected specifically for that purpose. No data are ever perfect - we always want more or better data - and no single study is ever definitive. When reading a paper, ask yourself: Did the authors do the best they could with the data and methods available, and are the conclusions they draw reasonable given the strengths and limitations of their particular study? Pay particular attention to how the phenotype was operationalized (that is, defined and measured): Does it seem reasonable (face validity)? Are there any concerns that they might not be measuring well what they’re trying to understand? General tips for reading Track common themes. As you’re reading the paper, consider which commonly addressed themes apply or are discussed (see Lecture Notes from Week 1). Take note of which themes the results support, and which if any they contradict. Recognizing these themes across different papers will help synthesize the information. Note a favorite table or graph. Often I find a figure or table that does a better job of presenting a main/interesting point than all of the text of the paper. When you discover a particularly useful table or figure, make note of it so that you can start there when referring back to the paper. Look for replications. One common “gold” standard for evidence in science is replication. Many GWAS include internal replication samples (that is, a smaller sample set aside specifically for the purpose of replicating any newly observed effects). You can also use Google Scholar to look for replications (either successful or null) by clicking on the “cited by” link below the paper’s search listing (any replication attempt will cite the original study). Keep in mind that science is slow, so new papers (especially &lt; 2 years old) may not yet have any available replication attempts reported, successful or otherwise. For any topic with more than a couple of studies available, try searching for a meta-analysis (a systematic empirical summary of available studies). Some papers may themselves be replications of prior findings, in which case they would usually cite those prior studies in the Introduction. Look for media coverage and public responses. Not all papers receive media or public attention, but where it exists it can reveal strengths and weaknesses both in terms of the study methods as well as the researchers’ attempt at communicating the conclusions. Especially high profile or controversial studies often receive a lot of discussion in public forums like Twitter. To find reactions, you can try searching for the article title or DOI (digital object identifier, now often included on the title page or at the very end of an article) in general or news search engines, twitter, Reddit, etc. Some journals and pre-print servers (for example, bioRxiv) aggregate tweets about a paper directly under it, or may show you an altmetric badge: a colorful circle with a number in it. Altmetric is a service that aggregates general references to papers across the internet and is quite thorough; click on the badge to view the various non-scholarly sources that have made reference to the paper (the higher the number, the more sources have discussed it; the more colorful, the more it’s appeared across different platforms). Some journals embed it, but for those that don’t, you can access it from any paper posted online using a bookmark. How to Read a Classical Twin Study Classical twin studies follow from the logic that regards twins as a “natural experiment”, where observations of a known experience that differs between individuals or over time and is not under the control of the researchers can be used to infer effects of “exposure” to the experience. In the specific case of twin studies, we are drawing conclusions about the effects of sharing 100% versus 50% of your genetic material with a person born at the same time and raised in the same family. Participants Monozygotic (MZ, or identical) twins result from the fertilization of a single egg by a single sperm, which then splits creating two zygotes that share 100% of their genetic material. They are naturally occurring genetic clones. Dizygotic (DZ, or fraternal) twins result from the independent fertilization of two eggs by two sperm at the same time. They share on average 50% of their genetic material and are no more or less genetically similar than any pair of full siblings. Conveniently for scientific inference, both types of twins happen to be born at the same time and the overwhelming majority are raised together, so we can ask ourselves: How similar are MZ twins to one another? And are MZ twins more similar to one another than DZ twins are? Because the answer to these questions rests on comparing the correlation between MZ twins (rMZ) to the correlation between DZ twins (rDZ), there need to be enough twin pairs included in the study to estimate a correlation well (more is better; 20 of each type is too few; 100 of each type is probably ok; 200+ of each type and I feel a lot better). Effect sizes Most commonly, you will be looking for standardized (that is, sum-to-1.0 or sum-to-100%) estimates of additive genetic (A, or a^2), shared or common environmental (C, or c^2), dominant genetic (D, or d^2), and non-shared or unique environmental (E or e^2) effects. For statistical reasons described below, we are limited to estimating three of those four potential sources of influences on individual differences, or “variance components,” to you will commonly find papers referring to fitting an ACE model or an ADE model. These are the factors they are referring to. How similar are MZ twins? This question allows us to address the issue of genetic determinism, and to estimate a variance component that behavior geneticists label non-shared or unique environmental influence. We usually describe twin similarity in terms of the correlation (r) between Twin 1’s phenotype and Twin 2’s phenotype. Correlations can be between 0 and 1 and can be either positive or negative. A correlation that is closer to 1 indicates that you would be very accurate at guessing the result of Measure 2 if you knew Measure 1 (or vice versa). A correlation closer to 0 indicates that you wouldn’t do better than random chance at trying to guess Measure 2 from Measure 1 (or vice versa). A positive correlation indicates that as the scores on one measure go up, the scores on the other measure are expected to go up; a negative correlation means that as scores on one measure go up, scores on the other go down. If the only influence on an outcome was genetics, and MZ twins share 100% of the same DNA, then we would expect the MZ twin correlation (rMZ) to be exactly equal to 1. Any rMZ lower than 1 suggests that there are non-genetic influences on the twins’ phenotypes that make them different. They could potentially be anything: different experiences, similar experiences responded to differently by each twin, or just pure measurement error (when we measure something poorly, it cannot correlate highly with other measures). We refer to these difference-making experiential factors as non-shared or unique environmental influences (E), and can estimate them from just rMZ using a Falconer (the guy who derived it) equation of: (eq. 4.1) E = 1 - rMZ We might have a problem if rMZ ever went negative (as in, if one twin becoming more something led the other twin to become less of that thing), but practically speaking that doesn’t happen for any of the measures that we use. It’s important to note that to calculate rMZ and estimate E, all we need to measure is the phenotype. We haven’t measured anything specific about E, so we can’t really say for sure what ‘E’ is - we just know that it’s stuff that is unshared or unique between MZ twins, even those raised in the same household. Are MZ twins more similar than DZ twins? Knowing whether and how much MZ twins are more similar than DZ twins allows us to estimate two other influences on individual differences (or variance components). One is additive genetic influences (A), a second is shared or common environmental influences (C), and a third is dominant genetic influences (D). There are no typos in the preceding sentences; when we only know the MZ twin correlation (rMZ) and the DZ twin correlation (rDZ), we’re going to need to choose whether we estimate C or D, but we can use the twin correlations to guide the choice. If rMZ is greater than rDZ, that suggests that there is something systematically making MZ twins more similar to one another on the phenotype than DZ twins - but what do MZ twins share more in common than DZ twins? We assume that it is genetics, and Falconer derived a handy estimate of additive genetic influences, which presumes that DZ twins are half as genetically similar as MZ twins, but still more similar than any two random individuals in the population, therefore additive effects could be estimated as twice the difference between their correlations: (eq. 4.2) A = 2 (rMZ - rDZ) Note this would cause a problem (that is, a negative A estimate) if the rDZ correlation was larger than the rDZ correlation but, like rMZ being negative, it just doesn’t happen in practice. Note this would cause a problem (that is, a negative A estimate) if the rDZ correlation was larger than the rDZ correlation but, like rMZ being negative, it just doesn’t happen in practice. Now, we need to decide whether to estimate shared or common environmental effects (C) or dominant genetic effects (D), and because of the limited information we have, we can’t estimate both at the same time. A key assumption here that has gone unstated so far is that the variance for the phenotype, whatever it is, is equal to 1 in both Twin 1 and Twin 2 (correlations are a standardized metric, meaning the measured have been adjusted or standardized to a variance of 1). So we actually have 4 pieces of information: the variance of the phenotype in Twin 1 and Twin 2, the MZ twin correlation, and the DZ twin correlation. In model fitting (even algebraically) you are limited to estimating: the number of pieces of information - 1. The short version is: the math breaks. So, accepting that without more data (such as correlations among different kind of family relationships, which absolutely does exist for some datasets but is an added time and money cost that isn’t as widely available as the base just-the-twins participant recruitment approach) we cannot estimate A, C, D, and E simultaneously, and also knowing that A and E are always non-zero (because rMZ &gt; rDZ and rMZ &lt; 1), we are left to choose between C and D, and to do this it helps to define them. Shared or common environmental influences (C) are (statistically speaking) things that make individuals who share an environment (usually defined as being raised together) more similar to one another, regardless of their genetic similarity. These sorts of influences would be expected to make twins more similar to one another across the board; so C makes rMZ greater than 0, but also make rDZ greater than 0, too, meaning that we would expect the outcome to be that MZ twins and DZ twins are more similarly similar than if that similarity was just down to differences in genetic similarity dosages alone, or, where rMZ &lt; 2*rDZ (that is, when MZ twins are less than twice more similar than DZ twins). C influences can be estimated using the Falconer equation: _(eq. 4.3) C = 2*rDZ - rMZ_ Dominant genetic influences (D) are defined as influences that make MZ twins more than twice as similar as DZ twins (so anything that makes them more similar and/or DZ twins less similar than the simple twice-as-much genotype comparison between the two twin types). This could refer to Mendelian-like dominance patterns but, statistically speaking, could arise from ANY non-linear relationship between genetic similarity and phenotype outcome, including gene-environment correlation and gene-environment interaction. D effects are implied when rMZ &gt; 2rDZ and are relatively rare across all phenotypes with one notable exception: personality. When we examine meta-analyses of twin studies of personality, we reliably find that the broad-sense heritability, or what is often labeled H or h^2 (encompassing both A and D components), is approximately 40%, with no-to-little C, and the rest due to E. But that overall heritability of 40% is about half A, half D (typical twin correlations are around rMZ = 0.45, rDZ = 0.15). Common tables and figures When we actually estimate ACE or ADE variance components in a twin study, although it is quite typical to report the raw twin correlations (because BG folk love to estimate Falconer equations in our heads - it’s a fun party trick?), we don’t usually rely on these estimates for the primary conclusions, and they become increasingly unhelpful as more complicated models are attempted, such as examining the relationship between two phenotypes, or the effect of one on another, or change over time. Path diagrams. Structural equation modeling (SEM) or path analysis allows us to derive predictions for the variances and covariances among variables (whether observed or inferred) under a specified model (that is, we have to define the possible relationships that may exist and should be estimated). To do that, we present relationships between variables using diagrams. The relationships can also be represented as structural equations or covariance matrices, but most people would rather have a picture. The first-ever path diagram (below, by Sewell Wright) was all about guinea pig inheritance. Now we sadly use circles, squares, and triangles in place of guinea pigs, but the interpretation is largely the same. Arrows indicate a directional influence from one thing (at the base of the arrow) to another (at the point). A double-headed arrow indicated a correlation between two things, without implying a particular direction. Concepts that are represented by squares are manifest variables (things that were actually observed or measured; in a twin study, these would be the phenotype measures of Twin 1 and Twin 2). Circles indicate latent variables (things that are not actually observed or measured, but rather are inferred to exist based on the statistical properties of the observed data; in a twin study, A, C, D, and E are latent variables). The number placed along a single- or double-headed arrow indicates the strength of the relationship that exists between the two variables. There are some really neat characteristics of path diagrams that allow you to infer the relationship between disparate manifest and/or latent variables by multiplying the parameters along connecting paths. Most importantly, it’s a flexible, universal notation methodology that allows us to change, add, and remove concepts and relationships and still be able to convey our statistical model to a wide audience. So, you’re going to FREQUENTLY encounter path diagrams in the twin study literature. There is exactly one difference between the pictures below, which are the path diagrams describing a standard ACE twin model. It is the entire basis of all of our estimates from classical twin studies. Note: The difference between the set-up for an ACE model versus the setup for an ADE model is whether the correlation between Twin 1 and Twin 2 “middle” component is 1.0 in both the MZ and DZ models (estimating C, which is shared 100% between twins regardless of zygosity), but 1.0 in the MZ model and 0.25 in the DZ model (which would estimate D, which is shared more than twice as much between MZs than DZs). Model fit statistics. When these and similar models are estimated, we use a method called Maximum Likelihood Estimation, where a program estimates that most likely values of a population or model parameter value given the observed data. Essentially, it runs through a guess-and-check process: pick some parameter values, see how well they reproduce the observed data, adjust, check again, until further adjustments don’t get any closer to matching the actual data. This is (thankfully) an automated process, so typically 10,000 iterations (or guess-and-check steps) get you a model that is as close as you’ll get to observed reality, given the model that you’ve asked the computer to estimate. One way we commonly compare alternative models is by looking at model fit statistics. There are a huge variety of ways we can summarize “how well the final model fits the observed data.” Typically model comparisons are made in a table that will have a (hopefully) clear note including what models were compared and how the “best” model was determined (some common measures are AIC and BIC, where smaller numbers are better, and RMSEA, where smaller numbers are also better but for different reasons, and CFI and TLI, where larger numbers are better). But, in the end, it’s the conclusion that matters and these model fit statistics rarely (or debatably) have any absolute interpretation - there’s never going to be a conclusion that suggests they’ve found the True model, just identification of one that was tested better fitting the current data than the others that happen to be tested/testable (again, constrained by information provided by the available data). Alternative models to compare typically try adding or dropping concepts, or fixing or freeing parameters, and see which of many models does the best job reproducing the observed data. Typically, the researchers will identify the best model that was tested on the current data (using whatever metric) and focus on the results of that one model in particular. How to Read a GWAS A genome-wide association study (GWAS, pronounced “GEE-wah-s”) is an exploratory method for discovering correlations between any one of many (often millions) of available genotyped variants (usually single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs, pronounced “snips”) and a phenotype of interest. It follows the process of (literally) checking each variant in turn for correlation with the phenotype. Because of this massive “multiple testing” problem, we adjust the typical threshold for statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05) for the equivalent of 1 million tests (that is, we divide 0.05 by 1 million); so a statistically significant result in a GWAS usually requires p &lt; 5 x 10^-8. (We do not divide by the total number of tested SNPs even if it is &gt;1 million - up to 17 million tests is now common - because the tests are not independent. That is, linkage disequilibrium means many tests are highly correlated, so it’s like doing the exact same test over and over again, where the result is guaranteed to be the same, so we don’t count it against the multiple testing burden.) Beyond evaluating whether there are significant associations observed, there are a variety of common ways that papers use to summarize the (millions of) results. Participants Because of the large number of tests, and the low threshold for statistical significance, and the anticipated small effect of any one SNP, we need a very large sample to detect any of these effects as statistically significant. (P-values are the result of a function depending on both the effect size AND the sample size - so if we’re looking for small p-values, we need either large effects - which we don’t expect in genetics - or a large sample.) For normal-range phenotypes (ie. anything not restricted to cases of extreme, severe, rare outcomes), which is the vast majority of work in behavior genetics, we typically need sample sizes over 100,000 participants for adequate “power” to detect our anticipated reasonable effect sizes as being statistically significant. Take note of any specific participant characteristics as well. Was the same limited to a certain ancestry group? (Most work so far has relied on samples of European ancestry; more research is now emerging in other ancestry groups in the past few years, but papers do still typically restrict to a single narrowly defined ancestry group.) Also note if they’re looking at only males or only females, or to a certain age group. This can inform how we interpret the phenotype and results. Common tables and figures Manhattan plot: This will be included in &gt;95% of all GWAS you encounter. It is a way to summarize the results of the millions of tests that have been performed. For examples, see this twitter bot that only tweets Manhattan plots derived from publicly available GWAS results: https://twitter.com/SbotGwa. The horizontal x-axis is a map of the genome, organized from left to right by chromosome, and within chromosome by location. Each dot represents a single tested SNP. The vertical location of the SNP along the y-axis is its p-value for the correlation of itself with the phenotype - but in Manhattan plots, the p-values are negative-log-transformed (that’s the -log10(p) label on the y-axis) so that SMALLER values are HIGHER on the plot. Basically, statistically significant SNPs are jumping up, saying “Look at me!”. There is usually a horizontal dotted line provided at the level of statistical significance (again, usually p &lt; 5x10^-8) so you can visually see where in the genome (by chromosome location) the statistically significant SNPs are located. Occasionally you will see a circular Manhattan plot; these are the same, except they are harder to read. People who use circular Manhattan plots are wrong. QQ Plot: These are falling out of fashion, but see the example from the Lecture Notes, Week 3, Principal Components Analysis section. The x-axis is the distribution of p-values under the null (assuming no effects, but randomly occurring low p-values due to multiple testing alone). The y-axis is the observed distribution of p-values across all tests. If the dots (again, representing each tested SNP) fall along the diagonal, then there are not statistically significant effects more than would be expected by chance. If there is “lift-off” from the diagonal (and the GWAS methods specify that ancestry principal components were included as covariates), then those SNPs have lower p-values than would be expected by chance alone. Barplots summarizing evidence: There are a wide variety of follow-up analyses that can be done using the GWAS results. Barplots are commonly used to summarize these results. Because the metrics can vary widely, it’s important to read the text to figure out what the axes are indicating. Usually, higher bars mean that thing/label is more “important”/strongly represented by lower p-values within the GWAS results; because the actual metric being depicted can be so variable, we often transform metrics to get them into this “bigger bar = more important” aesthetic. Effect Sizes NOTE: A p-value is not an effect size. It is the result of a function depending on both the effect size AND the sample size. A low p-value may occur either because there is a large effect OR because the sample size is large. Always Largest genetic effect: Depending on the paper, this may be presented in the text, or it may be buried in the supplement. Because of consistently small individual effect sizes, many papers now restrict reporting of individual SNP effects to summary depictions, such as the Manhattan and QQ plots, and provide a limited table of “top results”, or even a full table of millions of results, in the supplement. Usually, the effect size of a single SNP is reported in terms of its odds ratio (OR; for a binary yes/no outcome) or its correlation (r) or standardized regression weight (beta) (for continuous outcomes). Another commonly used effect size reporting metric is often labeled variance explained (r^2 - conveniently, the square of what the correlation metric would be). After the individual SNP results, there is a MULTITUDE of ways that the set of results may be summarized. Some common approaches are: Polygenic scores: Aggregation of genome-wide variants, summed like items on a test. Usually reported in terms of correlation (r) or variance explained (r^2). We know that effect sizes of polygenic scores tend to be inflated by parallel cultural transmission processes - the strongest test of a polygenic score is WITHIN FAMILIES (that is, how well does it correlate with phenotype differences within a family, eg. between siblings, where ancestry/cultural confounds are controlled). Under NO CIRCUMSTANCE should a polygenic score be tested in the exact same sample in which the SNP effects (GWAS) were estimated - this leads to CATASTROPHIC overestimation of the effect (eg. it’s not hard to get r^2 = 1.0, because the number of variables is greater than the number of participants, so “overfitting” to the sample is a BIG problem). Heritability among unrelated participants: The logic of twin studies can be extended to “unrelated” folks who have been genotyped, where we can ask the same question: to what extent are more closely related (more genetically similar) individuals more similar in their phenotypes? Genetic correlation with other phenotypes: Just like we can estimate correlations between observed phenotypes, so we can estimate the extent to which the pattern of results in a GWAS is similar to patterns of GWAS results observed for other phenotypes. Genetic correlation is typically scaled to range from 0.0 to +/- 1.0, REGARDLESS of the observed phenotypic correlation and the observed heritabilities of the phenotypes (so, even if the observed phenotypes are weakly correlated and/or weakly heritable, they can still show a high degree of genetic correlation, indicating that what phenotypic correlation/heritability there is can be traced to similar patterns of associated SNPs. Because most GWAS results these days are shared publicly in-full, it is relatively easy to take results from a single GWAS and estimate genetic correlation with any GWAS that has ever been done, without needing access to the underlying data (that is, the method requires only the results/summary statistics). Gene-based or Pathway analyses: Evaluation of whether p-values are lower than would be expected by chance within certain pre-defined sets of SNPs, such as individual genes or “pathways” (sets of multiple genes that share some common function, such as “dopamine genes” or “skeletal genes” or “genes expressed in the brain”). This is one of the RARE EXCEPTIONS to the “p-value is not an effect size” rule - most gene- or pathway-tests ONLY give a p-value as the result. The paper will usually tell you what the adjusted threshold for statistical significance is here - it will depend on the number of genes/pathways tested. Keep in mind that ONLY pre-defined genes/pathways CAN be tested - so it cannot test what we don’t yet know. Tissue/expression enrichment: There are a huge, rapidly developing array of methods for examining tissue expression and epigenetic mechanism “enrichment,” or (as in the gene- or pathway-based methods) overrepresentation of SNPs with low p-values in regions known to be expressed in certain tissues or known to be susceptible to variations in expression from a variety of factors (including but not limited to methylation, which is one commonly studied form of epigenetic modification). Prep Work Play Guess the Correlation The most common effect size you’ll encounter in this course is a correlation, whether it’s the phenotypic correlation between twins, or the correlation between a genetic variant and a phenotype, or the genetic correlation between two phenotypes. Practice visualizing what different correlations imply in terms of how consistent or spread out the data might be. It’s a simple website that for some reason is really strict about picking a unique username even though it won’t let you sign in to retrieve your results later. I usually just bang on my keyboard to generate a unique username to get in. Play p-hacker This web app illustrates how p-hacking (or running a bunch of different kinds of analyses - add or dropping participants until you get a significant result, looking at multiple outcomes without correcting the significant p-value threshold, running subgroup analyses without a theory or plan or correction for multiple testing) can get you a significant (low) p-value just by chance alone. It will simulate, analyze, and plot data according to your instructions. The Manual drop-down menu at the top left will give some tips. To make it feel genetic-y, label the experimental group “minor allele present (AB, BB)” and the control group “minor allele absent (AA)” and “test” for effects of the “genotype” on multiple “phenotypes” (set the number of DVs to 10). Instead of a correlation, the effect size used is cohen’s d (which describes the average difference between two groups). Larger values mean a bigger difference between the two groups. It’s a little different from a correlation in that it’s not bounded by +/- 1 (it can be infinitely large). But 0 still means “no effect”, or no difference between the two groups, or no relationship between the exposure and the outcome, and the interpretation of its p-values is still the same (it’s a combination of the size of the effect and the number of observations - larger effects and/or more observations lead to smaller, more significant p-values). Participation Activities You can earn up to 4 points for participation activities each week by selecting and completing tasks from the “menu” listed below. You may complete more than four tasks if you’d like, but the maximum number of points awarded will be 4 per week. Each activity is worth 1 point. Read &amp; Discuss via Perusall: Eftedal 2020 Estimating heritability of psychological traits using the classical twin design. PsyArXiv, version 2020, June 17, https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/g3f9c Read &amp; Discuss via Perusall: Tam et al 2019 Benefits and limitations of genome-wide association studies. Nature Reviews Genetics, 20(8), 467-484. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41576-019-0127-1 Activity: Citation Competition One of my most frequent professional tasks is to come up with a quick answer to the question: “What is the heritability of X?” or “Do we know any genes for Y?”. In this activity, you will practice finding references for and extracting key information from heritability and GWAS research. Computation Practical Exercise: Twin Heritability Two Ways Interpret a Manhattan plot posted by the GWAS Bot on Twitter. Go through @SbotGWA’s Twitter feed to pick a Manhattan plot. You’re going to post a summary of it to the News, Memes, and Everything In Between Discussion Forum, using the following format: Post subject = Manhattan plot of (fill-in-the-blank with the phenotype)_ Post body: A link to the @SbotGWA tweet you’ll be interpreting. Phenotype = a description of the phenotype (brief, enough so we can understand what they were looking at; find this by clicking -usually- the first or second link in the tweet). Say something interesting about the distribution of the phenotype (what’s the range of responses, is it normally distributed, does it differ by age - the available details will differ, so describe what you can). Sample size = the sample size of the GWAS usually included at the top of the tweet’s image; split into cases &amp; controls if that’s how it’s reported (i.e. for a binary outcome) Sample source = a brief description of the participants, whatever you can figure out. Most will be from the UK Biobank or FinnGen, some will include a listing of ancestry groups included. Is there at least one significant (p &lt; 5 E -8) association? If no, describe how you can tell. If yes, give the nearest gene (should be labeled on the plot next to the p-value peak) and the chromosome it is located on. Look up the gene and tell us if you see anything interesting about that gene - does it do something? Whether or not there is a significant SNP, choose one of the following options: Click through the top-SNP details (the last link in the tweet), find and report on anything interesting you notice there (you may need to use a fairly inclusive definition of “interesting”). If there are genetic correlations available (usually only for UK Biobank data), click through that link and report one genetic correlation you see (it could be the largest, or maybe the most interesting to you - dealer’s choice). Tip: Not infrequently you’ll find one with a quote-tweet highlighting &amp; explaining interesting results. Caveat: Credit will only be given for the first interpretation of a given tweet, so see what others have posted before you pick one to interpret. Journal Response: Compare Sample Sizes for Candidate Genes to GWAS Go through the responses in the News, Memes, and Everything In Between Discussion Forum posting (a) results from recent Candidate Gene studies in Week 2 and (b) results from the twitter GWAS Bot in Week 4. Make a bar graph (in Excel, R, drawn by hand, whatever you prefer) comparing the average sample size from the posted candidate gene studies (average sample sizes from at least 10 postings) to the average sample size from the posted GWAS (again, average sample sizes from at least 10 postings - you may need to wait ’til later in the week to gather these data). Include in your very brief journal response: Embed an image of the graph you made. What you notice about the comparison. How you interpret that comparison. Class Chat on Thursday, 11:00 am - 12:20 pm Class Chat Activity: Citation Quick-Draw During the class chat, I’ll randomly assign you to teams in separate breakout rooms. Working as a team in your breakout room, find citations and report results for heritability and GWAS studies of target topics. The team with the most “points” (largest study wins the point) “wins” (pride of accomplishment). A link to the Target &amp; Final Answer Google Slides will be posted in Moodle. View the target prompts and post your team’s final answer on the slides, or try to “steal” the point by finding a bigger study than what other teams have already posted. Each target appears as an existing slide, with a textbox on each slide for each team. To win a point, be the first to fill in your team’s textbox on a given slide with: The APA-formatted paper citation The sample size/number of participants the result is based on The operationalization of the phenotype (That is: What was the behavior/outcome and how was it measured/defined? How were participants’ phenotype status determined?) The result: For heritability questions, the percent (%) heritability. For GWAS questions, whether or not they found a significant SNP associated with the phenotype. The largest study gets the point. Another team may “steal” the point by typing into their own textbox on that same slide: identifying &amp; correcting an error in another team’s final answer; OR posting a study with a larger sample size. Course Project Assignment Due Unless otherwise specified, assignments are due by Friday 5:00 pm CT for the Week in which they are listed. Project Milestone 1: Topic + 5 references "],["team-project-core-phenotypes.html", "Week 5 Team Project: Core Phenotypes Objectives Lecture Notes Prep Work Participation Activities Team Resources", " Week 5 Team Project: Core Phenotypes Although behavior genetic methods can be applied to any phenotype you can imagine, some have received more attention than others. This week you will be reviewing the literature on one of the most investigated phenotypes in behavior genetics and producing a summary of what we currently know and how it does (or does not) fit with our expectations based on the Themes in Behavior Genetics. Team assignments will be posted on Moodle. Objectives Become familiar with when and how to use the Empirical Article Summary template and the Review Article Summary template to keep track of key information as you’re reading. Identify common themes across papers. Create a team summary of your phenotype using the Topic Summary template. Lecture Notes This week our goal is to learn about some of the most-investigated phenotypes in BG by breaking down some pre-selected papers (for each phenotype, one twin study estimate of heritability, one GWAS, and one or two review papers), finding supplemental papers, and looking at their core conclusions and how they fit into the framework of common themes in behavior genetics (see the very end of Week 1 Lecture Notes). I was able to get everyone into one of their top 3 preferred phenotype teams, so keep in mind that you and your teammates have at least one thing in common - you’re interested in this topic! That’s the best starting point to build a successful collaboration, even if only for a short time. Do first: Check your team assignment, posted at the top of the Week 5 tab. Make sure you can access your team discussion forum for Week 5 (posted below your team’s pre-selected readings). Make sure you can access (or request access to) your team google doc (posted below your team’s discussion board; access to the doc does require a login so I can see who contributed what). Skim your team’s pre-selected papers (note: SKIM, you are not expected to do a deep-read of all of these). This week we will have Zoom meetings on both Tuesday and Thursday (11:00 am - 12:20 pm Central). During these sessions, you will work together to: [Tuesday] Complete an Empirical Article Summary for your twin study and GWAS papers and a Review Article Summary for your review paper(s). [Thursday] Draft a Topic Summary about BG research on your phenotype. As always, there are four asynchronous options to contribute to your team effort this week. However, I encourage you to attend this week’s Zoom sessions if at all possible, because working through these activities as a group is the easiest way to develop these skills. As I work through providing feedback on your topic and reference selections, it’s a good time to look ahead to Project Milestone 2: 10 article summaries, which is due at the end of Week 8. For that assignment, you’ll be using the same Empirical Article Summary and Review Article Summary templates that you’re working with this week. If you start working on your 10 article summaries this week, you can do 2-3 per week and be done on time. You should receive specific feedback from me on your topic and proposed references by the end of the week; feel free to start on your article summaries in the meantime. If you’re particularly concerned about your proposed topic and want to receive feedback sooner rather than later (that is, before starting on your article summaries), feel free to email me or schedule a time to chat briefly. Prep Work Below is a listing of materials to review early in the week. Although these activities do not earn points, they will prepare you to undertake the Participation Activities and Course Project assignments. Skim the papers posted on your team’s resources list below Your team will be working together to create formal summaries of these papers during Tuesday’s Zoom session, but you should become generally familiar with them before/even if you’re not attending Tuesday’s Zoom session. Each team starts with one twin study, one GWAS, and one or two review papers. Participation Activities You can earn up to 4 points for participation activities each week by selecting and completing tasks from the “menu” listed below. You may complete more than four tasks if you’d like, but the maximum number of points awarded will be 4 per week. Each activity is worth 1 point. Find and summarize an empirical article (other than those that have been pre-selected) about the genetics of your team’s phenotype. An Empirical Article is a scholarly source that does a new analysis of data (that is, it is not just a review of previous research; it will almost certainly include sections labeled Methods and Results). Make the subject of your post: [summary] Article title (N = number of participants). For the body of your post, fill out an Empirical Article Summary template Post your completed Empirical Article Summary to your team’s discussion forum. Find a popular source about the genetics of your team’s phenotype, find the scholarly source that it is reporting, and post both to your team’s discussion forum. Make the subject of your post: [scicomm] Popular media piece title In the body of your post, include: A link to the popular source. The APA-formatted citation for the scholarly source it is reporting on. A brief (1-2 sentences) summary of the topic being addressed. A brief (1-2 sentences) evaluation of how accurate the popular source reporting is to the original scholarly source. Write a tweet thread (4 or more tweets, &lt;280 characters each, link/image/gifs optional) about the genetics of your team’s phenotype (citing the pre-selected readings and/or papers that have been posted to your team’s discussion forum) and post it to your team’s discussion forum. Make the subject of your post: [tweets] First few words of the first tweet. For some inspiration, check out this twitter list of authors whose work you have/will read in this class, plus some of my favorite scicommers. Important: You are not required to actually tweet anything; it’s enough to prepare &amp; post here the text/images in that style. Journal Response: Editing Do some editing of your team’s Topic Summary draft (in the team google doc, produced during the Thursday live Zoom session). For example: Add information from posts in your team’s discussion forum. Add details about individual studies to existing text: sample sizes, participant characteristics, phenotype operationalizations, effect sizes, replication attempts. Paraphrase direct quotes; only quote something directly if the original phrasing was so perfect and beautiful that to rephrase it would be a crime against language. Work through one or more of the steps of Randy McCarthy’s suggestions for self-editing your writing to edit your team’s Topic Summary draft. For participation activity credit: Write a couple of sentences reflecting on what you changed or added and how those changes impact the summary overall.

However, I encourage you to attend this week’s Zoom sessions if at all possible, because working through these activities as a group is the easiest way to develop these skills. The readings for Week 6 and Week 7 are essentially the same. This week, you’ll be developing expertise in your particular method. Next week, you’ll be rotating into phenotype-based teams, where you’re goal will be to synthesize research from a variety of methods applied to a single phenotype, with the goal of answering the question: Do genes cause (human) behavior? The challenge is that most of our expectations for causal reasoning rely on the availability of experimental evidence. When working with human genetics, or in many fields of observational relationships between (for example) environments and phenotypes, we can’t randomly assign folks to different conditions (whether those conditions are genetic, or environmental - for example, we can’t randomly assign people to different families, or to smoke or not smoke, or to different socioeconomic statuses). Behavior genetics provides a variety of methods to potentially address some of the expectations and assumptions that would arise from a causal relationship, even in the absence of direct experimental manipulation. Each of these methods comes with its own benefits, limitations, things we can learn, and assumptions they rely on. Drawing causal conclusions often relies on the principle of “triangulation” among methods: no single non-experimental method will be conclusive, but if we draw similar conclusions from applying a broad diversity of available methods, we can become reasonably confident that a causal relationship exists even in the absence of experimental research in humans. A classic example of this is the relationship between smoking and cancer. There has never been a randomized control trial of the long-term health consequences of smoking in humans because you couldn’t (either practically or ethically) randomly assign people to smoke or not smoke over the course of decades. Rather, we look at converging evidence from many methods to conclude that either the relationship is causal OR all of the methods (again, based on different assumptions) just happen to be biased in the same wrong direction (a situation that I personally take to be rather unlikely, but your mileage may vary). Prep Work Skim the papers posted on your team’s resources list below Some of these papers (especially GWAS) will include MANY methods within the same source. This week, pay particular attention (i.e. search, ctrl-F) to any section(s) about the results of the application of your team’s method. Your team will be working together to create formal summaries of these papers during Tuesday’s Zoom session, but you should become generally familiar with them before/even if you’re not attending Tuesday’s Zoom session.

II: Phenotype Teams Objectives Lecture Notes Prep Work Participation Activities Team Resources", " Week 7 Do Genes Cause Behavior? II: Phenotype Teams This week, you’ll take your methodological expertise developed in Week 6 and rotate into phenotype-based teams, to bring together a variety of different methods to understand a particular phenotype. Team assignments will be posted on Moodle. Objectives Understand how a variety of different methods can address the same topic. Synthesize research across methods to identify areas of common agreement, limitations of one method addressed by another, and areas where the different approaches disagree. Lecture Notes This week our goal is to apply a variety of genetically informative methods to understanding what causes (or is caused by) a particular phenotype. As soon as possible: Check your team assignment. Make sure you can access your team discussion forum for Week 7 (posted in Moodle below your team’s pre-selected readings). Make sure you can access (or request access to) your team google doc for Week 7 (posted below your team’s discussion board; access to the doc does require a login so I can see who contributed what). Skim your team’s pre-selected papers (note: SKIM, you are not expected to do a deep-read of all of these). This week we will have Zoom meetings on both Tuesday and Thursday (11:00 am - 12:20 pm Central). During these sessions, you will work together to: [Tuesday] Complete article summaries for some of your pre-selected papers, starting from what was accomplished last week when the methods teams were working with the same readings. [Thursday] Assemble a Topic Summary about your phenotype, focusing on the question(s): What causes (or is caused by) your team’s phenotype? As always, there are four asynchronous options to contribute to your team effort this week. However, I encourage you to attend this week’s Zoom sessions if at all possible, because working through these activities as a group is the easiest way to develop these skills. The readings for Week 6 and Week 7 are essentially the same. Last week, you developed expertise by examining how a specific method has been applied across many phenotypes. This week, your goal is to synthesize research from across a variety of methods to develop your understanding of how your team’s phenotype fits into a complex network of potential causal influences. In particular in the Briley et al. (2018) paper, pay attention to Figures 1, 2, &amp; 3, which illustrate alternative causal pathways that might result in similar observed correlational patterns. Depending on the true causal pathway, intervening in the genes (if you wanted to) wouldn’t necessarily change the outcome even though a genetic association or heritability would have been robustly observed. Similarly, genetic methods can help us disentangle the causal ordering of phenotypic and environmental characteristics. For example, if we want to improve educational outcomes, should we try to change children (grit, mindset, test training) or change schools (resources, structures) or change families (reading together, resources stabilities, parenting approaches)? Whenever our goal is to change outcomes, we need to identify the causal relationships among a whole bunch of correlated variables to predict which features may be most effective to target for interventions (and we must always make choices about where and when to intervene, prevent, or treat; these decisions are costly and often necessarily mean NOT intervening/preventing/treating other areas). Genetically informative research designs don’t only tell us about genes; they offer an opportunity to anchor our understanding of the relationships among non-genetic factors, as well, even when human experimentation is impractical, unethical, or impossible. Prep Work Skim the papers posted on your team’s resources list below Your team will be working together to create formal summaries of these papers during Tuesday’s Zoom session, but you should become generally familiar with them before/even if you’re not attending Tuesday’s Zoom session. Each team starts with 4-7 empirical papers applying one or more methods we covered in Week 6. Participation Activities Read &amp; Discuss via Perusall: Briley et al 2018 Behaviour Genetic Frameworks of Causal Reasoning for Personality Psychology. https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2153 This piece gives an overview of causal reasoning (i.e. a little bit on each of the methods your teams started with last week). Although it’s about “personality,” that’s really only because it was written for a personality journal; you could swap the phenotypes and environments illustrated in Figures 1-3 and all the same reasoning would apply. The one element that is relatively specific to personality is the discussion of dominance (non-additive) genetic effects, which are not observed nearly as often for non-personality phenotypes. Find and summarize an empirical article (other than those that have been pre-selected) about the genetics of your team’s phenotype. An Empirical Article is a scholarly source that does a new analysis of data (that is, it is not just a review of previous research; it will almost certainly include sections labeled Methods and Results). Make the subject of your post: [summary] Article title (N = number of participants). For the body of your post, fill out an Empirical Article Summary template about the empirical article you have selected. Post your completed Empirical Article Summary to your team’s discussion forum. Find a popular source about the genetics of your team’s phenotype, find the scholarly source that it is reporting, and post both to your team’s discussion forum. Make the subject of your post: [scicomm] Popular source title In the body of your post, include: A link to the popular source. The APA-formatted citation for the scholarly source it is reporting on. A brief (1-2 sentences) summary of the topic being addressed. A brief (1-2 sentences) evaluation of how accurate the popular source reporting is to the original scholarly source. Write a tweet thread (4 or more tweets, &lt;280 characters each, link/image/gifs optional) about the genetics of your team’s phenotype (citing the pre-selected readings and/or papers that have been posted to your team’s discussion forum) and post it to your team’s discussion forum. Make the subject of your post: [tweets] First few words of the first tweet. For some inspiration, check out this twitter list of authors whose work you have/will read in this class, plus some of my favorite scicommers. Journal Response: Editing Do some editing of your team’s Topic Summary draft (in the team google doc, produced during the Thursday live Zoom session). For example: Add information from posts in your team’s discussion forum. Add details about individual studies to existing text: sample sizes, participant characteristics, phenotype operationalizations, effect sizes, replication attempts. Paraphrase direct quotes; only quote something directly if the original phrasing was so perfect and beautiful that to rephrase it would be a crime against language. Work through one or more of the steps of Randy McCarthy’s suggestions for self-editing your writing to edit your team’s Topic Summary draft. For participation activity credit: Write a couple of sentences reflecting on what you changed or added and how those changes impact the summary overall. Team Learning Project on Tuesday, 11:00 am - 12:20 pm Using the article summaries generated in Week 6 as a starting point, work together to fill out Empirical Article Summary templates describing your team’s pre-selected papers. Each team starts with 4-7 empirical papers applying one or more methods we covered in Week 6. Team Learning Project on Thursday, 11:00 am - 12:20 pm Work together to draft a Topic Summary about your team’s phenotype. Team Resources Pre-selected articles are listed below.

Lecture Notes This week is entirely about getting your Project Milestone 2: 10 article summaries completed. You’ve already read, evaluated, and synthesized a lot of research this semester. As you’re working through the article summaries for your Course Project, remember you can look back on what you (and others) have done each week for examples of how to present materials (pay attention both to what has worked, as well as what hasn’t). The Participation Activities this week are entirely in service of the goal of completing and considering in-depth the articles that you’ve selected for your Project Milestone 2: 10 article summaries assignment, including sharing good resources you’ve found with each other and thinking through how you might begin assembling the massive amount of information that you’re gathering into concise summary presentations in future weeks. Participation Activities Post your article summary for your Project Milestone 2 article that you found EASIEST to read to the Article Summary Sharing Forum (above). Include above your summary a brief statement (2-3 sentences) about what made the article particularly easy to read. Make the topic of your post: [easy] Article Title. Post your article summary for your Project Milestone 2 article that you found MOST HELPFUL for understanding your topic to the Article Summary Sharing Forum (above). Include above your summary a brief statement (2-3 sentences) about what made the article particularly useful for gaining understanding about your topic. Make the topic of your post: [helpful] Article Title. Chat with Jaime for 15 minutes via Zoom about any questions you have about your Course Project topic or readings (for example, help finding/interpreting details from specific readings). Make an appointment via the Calendly link in Moodle. (If you have previously chatted with Jaime, you will automatically receive credit for this participation activity, but are of course always welcome to make another appointment.)

Course Project Assignment Due Project Milestone 2: 10 article summaries "],["science-communication.html", "Week 9 Science Communication Objectives Lecture Notes Prep Work Participation Activities", " Week 9 Science Communication Constructive criticism and evaluation of writing, both scholarly and popular, is a skill that requires practice. Objectives Learn to identify common strengths and weaknesses in scholarly and popular science communication. Practice providing academic journal-style peer review. Lecture Notes All the data and statistical models in the world won’t mean anything if we can’t communicate our findings with the outside world. Communication can take many forms and may need to address many different audiences. In academic settings, we most often think of a peer-reviewed journal article as the ultimate product of communication, but there are many intermediate and additional formats that even academic communication can take. Sharing drafts for feedback, giving presentations to gauge audience interest, and contributing to press coverage either through press releases from our institutions or by engaging with journalists are common mechanisms for making sure that our science reaches as many interested parties as possible. Each audience has different expectations and goals for what they want to gain from an understanding of scientific research, and each step along the way introduces new challenges for producing communication that is clear, correct, and interesting. Most scientists are never formally trained to write. We learn by doing and by responding to feedback, often from other academics, and do our best to adjust over time. And our incentives are absolutely to produce engaging content; articles and researchers are often judged on the number of citations they receive, a powerful reinforcement for producing titles and abstracts that attract as much attention as possible. In science journalism, the reinforcer is often the number of page clicks generated (because of ad revenue). Although we may assume academics and journalists have similar goals (Truth) often the questions asked and the form of truth sought may differ substantially (for example: basic science questions like what? or how? versus applied questions like ‘how might this be used?’) and the audiences may be wildly different (other experts versus the general public). These different goals may lead to different aspects being emphasized or sometimes addressed versus unaddressed altogether. This is also a good place to note one major difference between academic and journalistic writing: in academic writing, we usually maintain close to total control of the version of the writing that is ultimately published; in journalism, it’s common for the editor to pick the title of the piece (rather than being up to the person whose byline appears underneath). Again, the goals of these parties may be wildly different - it’s not uncommon to see extremely clickbaity headlines on a perfectly reasonable piece of science journalism. This week you’ll be reading a bit about the current state of public communication and knowledge about genetics, you’ll practice providing academic peer review using a template (the key here: review as you would like to be reviewed), and in our Zoom class chat on Thursday we’ll generate some considerations to keep in mind whenever we endeavor to communicate science (whether to public or academic audiences). An important lesson from all of this is that the system is far from perfect at every stage: we rely on authors to report fully and clearly, we rely on peer reviewers to provide careful and constructive feedback (in the ‘real world’ they often do not; borderline abusive peer review is sadly not uncommon due to the anonymous nature of most peer review formats and is left to the editor handling the paper for the journal - in this case, me - to ensure that unhelpful comments are intercepted), we rely on institutional press offices to produce accurate press releases, we rely on journalists to faithfully report results, other scientists to provide accurate and informative context, and editors not to seek page-clicks and controversy at the expense of accuracy. There’s a lot of places in the process where something can go wrong - either intentionally or unintentionally - and learning to critically evaluate the communication you’re presented with is a useful skill that we’re working to develop, not just this week but throughout the semester, to be able to apply more broadly outside the confines of this class. As you work through the activities this week, keep in mind your next Course Project Milestone 3: Draft paper due at the end of Week 11. In particular, pay attention to what you see across various forms of science communication that you like, as well as what you don’t like, so that you can mimic (or avoid) those features in your own writing. Prep Work If you’re planning to attend this week’s Class Chat, we’ll be doing two in-class activities that you’ll need to take a few minutes before class to prepare for: Be ready to briefly describe one of the scholarly sources you completed an article summary template for Project Milestone 2. You may want to pull up the scholarly source and/or your summary as a reference to have on hand. Look back over one or more of your own or others’ posts comparing a popular source to a scholarly source (participation activities in Weeks 1, 5, 7, and 8). Be ready to discuss what you’ve seen that you like - and what you don’t like - in popular source coverage of science. Participation Activities Read &amp; Discuss via Perusall: Chapman et al 2019 New literacy challenge for the twenty-first century- genetic knowledge is poor even among well educated. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12687-018-0363-7 Read &amp; Discuss via Perusall: Morosoli et al 2020 Understanding science communication in human genetics using text mining. https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.24.219683 Peer Review previously drafted Topic Summaries. Following the Peer Review template from the Resources tab, post a peer review for a previous week’s team project topic summary (for which you were NOT a team member). Peer review assignments will be posted in Moodle- you will only receive credit for peer-reviewing your assigned topic summaries. Each topic summary is posted to the Peer Review Forum as its own thread. Post your review as a reply to the existing thread. This activity can be completed up to 2 times, for 1 point per review. Revise a Topic Summary Pick ONE Topic Summary that you were either a part of the team for in Weeks 5 and 7 OR that you were assigned as a Peer Review option this week AND that has received at least 2 peer reviews (so you have something to guide your edits). Using track-changes (so I can see what you’ve changed), revise the Topic Summary (adding details, smoothing language and structure, correcting grammar), and submit it in Moodle. Your final summary should be between 750 and 1000 words (not including references; about the length of a blog post) and include at least one image (such as a figure from a source or an eye-catching stock photo relevant to your topic; my favorite free stock photo source is Pixabay). Class Chat, Thursday, 11:00 am - 12:20 pm (CT) We’ll be doing two in-class activities that you’ll need to take a few minutes before class to prepare for: Be ready to briefly describe one of the scholarly sources you completed an article summary template for Project Milestone 2. You may want to pull up the scholarly source and/or your summary as a reference to have on hand. Look back over one or more of your own or others’ posts comparing a popular source to a scholarly source (participation activities in Weeks 1, 5, 7, and 8).

"],["genetic-engineering.html", "Week 10 Genetic Engineering Objectives Lecture Notes Prep Work Participation Activities", " Week 10 Genetic Engineering This week we discuss current and near-future potential applications of genetic knowledge. Recent technological developments have led to an increased interest in the broad field of personalized medicine, including attempts to make predictions about a person on the basis of their genotype. We will consider three issues in particular: Could we? Should we? And, would we? Objectives Introduce current technologies in genetic engineering. Consider the potential effectiveness of these technologies (could we?). Consider the ethical issues around use of these technologies (should we?). Consider the social acceptability of personal or policy applications of these technologies (would we?). Lecture Notes The movie Gattaca (1997) is about a near-future world where people are judged on their genetic profiles. It’s very smoky, includes at least one too many unnecessary plot twists, and is poorly lit with a score that is inexplicably loud. But its scientific basis is essentially what we now call polygenic scores. This future society uses polygenic scores to predict an individual’s health and behavioral outcomes at birth, screen for employment eligibility, and evaluate romantic partners. Parents can choose to selectively implant embryos with the best polygenic scores (and in a deleted scene, given the option to edit the DNA beyond that for an additional fee): https://youtu.be/PFjaOnCp0lo Could we? The technology to attempt this already exists. Direct-to-consumer genotyping services, like 23andMe, offer users genomic ancestry estimates and predictions of probabilities for a variety of health and behavioral outcomes. Although the major DTC companies don’t venture too far into unusual or non-disease-relevant traits, a nearly infinite supply of third-party services now allow you to upload your DNA files obtained from these companies to platforms that will estimate your status on any polygenic score that exists. But how accurate are these services likely to be? For outcomes that are due to a single gene effect, they can be hugely useful. Screening for major disease carrier status is common among individuals who are known to be at risk. For example, individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry are often screened for Tay-Sachs carrier status, which is a recessive neurological disorder that leads to a horrific, painful death usually within the first few years of life. Israel has a nationwide screening program available to encourage carriers to know their status and use it to make reproductive decisions (for example, who to date or whether to adopt instead) - and the program of socially-supported widespread screening is effective. 1 out of every 30 people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry is a carrier of Tay-Sachs, but the birth rate of affected individuals is substantially below what would be expected (only 1 in 3,500 births, less than the expected rate of 1/30 * 1/30 = 1 in 900). This suggests that, with widespread screening and even in the absence of policy mandates, people are using genetic information to make reproductive decisions. But this is an extreme example - how far would such screening go? One question would be: how certain can we be? For behavioral outcomes, the absolute upper limit for how well we could ever predict from a person’s genome is the estimate of heritability. If you take the square root of a heritability estimate, you get the absolute highest correlation that could ever be achieved by a polygenic score for that trait (assuming that we could identify all the genes to go into that score and that all of the assumptions that go into estimating heritability are correct - so it would be an optimistic assumption. If the heritability of the trait were around 50%, that would give us a maximum potential correlation between an absolutely perfect polygenic score and the trait of around 0.7. And remember, this is a VERY optimistic prediction. Polygenic scores are limited to common variants, and often heritability estimates from GWAS data are around half of what’s obtained in twin data - meaning that construct that’s 50% heritable might only be 25% heritable due to common genetic variants (where rare variants will likely always remain too rare to properly score - at least until we understand function a lot better than we do now) which would put its absolutely most optimistic maximum correlation with the trait outcome at around 0.5. Would we? Early selective implantation technology was, like many reproductive technologies, originally developed for use in agriculture, to produce more efficient ratios of males-to-females and to breed more productive animals overall. The same basic technology that is used to screen livestock animal embryos for sex or size or temperament could in principle be applied in humans, as well - although the process does necessarily involve in vitro fertilization (IVF) to allow screening before implantation. It’s common for fertility clinics to screen embryos for major genetic diseases before implantation. It’s also not uncommon for the selection of embryo sex chromosomes to be an option. There have even been recent reports of clinics offering screening on the basis of polygenic scores, including those for height and intelligence. One major deciding factor that comes up in screening, in general, is whether there are any effective interventions. That is - if you know about something, would you be able to do something about it? And if that something is genetic, does the intervention necessarily need to be genetic, too? Myopia (nearsightedness) is heritable, but we have a very effective environmental intervention: glasses. There’s a major metabolic disorder called PKU (phenylketonuria). It’s caused by a single genetic mutation that usually arises de novo (not inherited from either parent) and if left untreated will cause severe intellectual disability and behavioral problems (a result of the body being unable to break down phenylalanine, an amino acid that is present in most foods). It occurs about 1 out of every 10,000 births - and I can guarantee that every single person in this class was screened for it at birth. The PKU screen is non-genetic - it’s a blood spot test that measures metabolite levels. It’s administered at or shortly after birth in every country with a developed health care system - because it’s treatable. As long as someone with PKU avoids foods containing phenylalanine, they will be largely phenotypically normal - a genetic disorder with an environmental intervention. Should we? The discussion about whether or not to apply genetic engineering to humans is almost certainly less a question of “Yes or No?” and more “Where’s the line?”. The history of technology consistently follows a trend where new technologies are first demonized, then accepted (see for example: bicycles, writing on paper instead of slate tablets, radio, in vitro fertilization). Very few people working on these issues argue either there should never be any application of screening or even modification (see: major single-mutation-determined disorders) or that there should be no restrictions. But where to draw that line varies substantially between individuals, and is an issue that we need to address with increasing urgency. As the technology becomes cheaper and more reliable, there will continue to be a market for services like direct-to-consumer genotyping and embryo selection, and even embryo genetic modification. What we choose to do with this technology may have sweeping consequences - and it may turn out that we’ve spent a bunch of money and human pain on predictions that were never going to be accurate in the first place. “There is no gene for the human spirit.” - the actual tagline for Gattaca Prep Work Fill out the (anonymous) Interest in Genetic Modification survey.

Everyone is welcome to use my results. If you have your own direct-to-consumer genetic info, you may use that instead to respond to the following prompt. Journal Assignment: Select any three themes from behavior genetics (see Lecture Notes, the bottom of Week 1). For each theme, write a brief (100-200 words) description of how that theme relates to the presentation of direct-to-consumer genetic testing results. You can address the science, communication, ethics, any aspects that strike you as important. Journal Response:: Themes in Fiction Find a fictional portrayal of genetic testing or engineering and connect it to three of the themes in behavior genetics. You can pick anything - feel free to be creative and/or esoteric. A few examples: Gattaca (1997): There are sadly no non-rental options available right now, but this playlist of 8 short clips + the trailer hits the important points in &lt;20 minutes. Rampage (2018) or any of the Jurassic Parks: Not about humans, but there’s plenty of discussion of complex behavioral phenotypes, genes, and environments. You could absolutely analyze three themes relevant to the opening line of Lizzo’s Truth Hurts, \"I just took a DNA test, turns out I’m 100% that b*tch.\" Journal Assignment: At the top, state what fictional work you are discussing (give me enough detail that I could look it up if I’m not familiar). Select any three themes from behavior genetics (see Lecture Notes, the bottom of Week 1).

A court of law is an example of different, yet still concrete, goals - the defense wants to get the lightest sentence or a “not guilty” finding, while the prosecution typically seeks the most severe sentence available. The two sides are necessarily working with the same facts, yet are motivated to interpret them very differently. Objectives Understand the recent history of the uses of behavior genetics research in legal settings. Consider various societal and ethical implications of different interpretations of the same scientific information.

You may choose to be a member of the PROSECUTION or the DEFENSE. (If you don’t have a preference, flip a coin: heads is Prosecution, tails is Defense. If you don’t have a physical coin, type “flip a coin” into google.) Then, choose one of three options to post or respond to in-character: For your chosen side (PROSECUTION or DEFENSE), respond to one of the two available prompts below (threads started by Jaime), OR Head over to one of the prompt threads for the OTHER side and RESPOND to one post there, staying in-character as a researcher for the opposing side, OR Respond to one instance of the OTHER side responding to YOUR side (e.g. if you’re the defense, post a response to a prosecutor responding to an original defense-side post). Journal Response: Aggression GWAS press release Write and post a short press release for an imaginary future study on the genetics of aggression, addressing how such information could or should be used in a legal setting. Imagine it is the future and you have just completed the largest ever study of the genetics of aggression* (either a twin-heritability study or a GWAS, your choice). Write a short (no more than 500 words) press release for your paper. It should include information on the method (a brief, layperson-friendly description), your sample (as large and with whatever demographic characteristics you would like), your phenotype operationalization (how did you define ‘aggression’?), and the primary results. All of this information will be completely made up, but must conform to what we would expect given the themes that emerge across phenotypes (e.g. everything is somewhat but not completely heritable, many genes of small effect, etc.). At the end, briefly (in 2-3 sentences) address how this information could, and whether it should, be used in the context of the criminal justice system. That is, if you were to be called as an “expert witness” in a murder trial (such as Tennessee v Waldroup (2010), which was also discussed in the Week 2 Class Chat/Lecture on MAOA; recording available in Moodle) on the basis of your just-published-imaginary-paper and expertise in the genetics of aggression, what would you say?

You may choose any topic related to the course content (behavior genetics), as long as I approve of it. You will produce a final paper of about 3,500 to 4,000 words (12 – 15 pages) for undergrads, or 4,000 to 4,500 words (15 – 18 pages) for grad students, plus references. I care more about clarity, insight, evidence, and the flow of argument than about length. Expect to read at least 10 – 20 published research papers on your topic of choice. For graduate students, plan to produce a paper that you could turn around and submit as a review in a decent journal or a book chapter. Objectives Identify, understand, and synthesize recent and historic primary research articles. Develop expertise in a specific topic of interest. Communicate knowledge to a general audience. Project Schedule As shown in the table below, the course project consists of seven milestones leading up to, and including, a final term paper. Activity Deadline Points Topic + 5 references Week 4, Friday 3 points 10 article summaries Week 8, Friday 15 points Draft paper Week 11, Friday 10 points Draft digital media project Week 12, Friday 4 points Paper peer reviews Week 13, Friday 5 points Final digital media project Week 14, Friday 4 points Final paper “Finals day” 9 points Project Milestone 1: Topic + 5 references Developing your Course Project will take time and deliberate (ideally, spaced-out) attention. We begin early by identifying a topic and (importantly) making sure that there is likely enough research that you’ll be able to eventually build a whole term paper around it. For feedback on this assignment, I try to provide additional recommended sources based on your topic and the scholarly sources that you’ve identified as potentially interesting - I can use this information to figure out what specific direction and additional keywords might be interesting for you personally. Objectives Identify a topic you are interested in becoming an expert at. Practice searching the relevant published scientific literature. Time Estimate 4-5 hours Assignment Instructions Select a topic for your Course Project and find 5 promising scholarly sources. You do NOT need to read the entirety of each source right away but do read the abstract to be sure that the source is (1) relevant to your topic, (2) potentially interesting, and (3) scholarly (see Week 1 Prep Work for a link to learn to distinguish scholarly sources from popular sources). Most importantly: Pick a topic you’re interested in! You may choose any topic related to the course content (behavior genetics). Tip 1: If your topic is a specific phenotype, try searching Google Scholar for: [phenotype] heritability [phenotype] GWAS [phenotype] genetics Tip 2: Google Scholar sorts results to prioritize highly cited papers. You may want to restrict to recent publication years so you don’t get a bunch of out-of-date research (for example, select the ‘Since 2017’ option at top left). Tip 3: If you find a paper you like, look for papers that that paper cites, or that cite that paper (click the ‘Cited by’ link under the reference listing in Google Scholar). Tip 4: Where an author’s name is underlined in the reference listing on Google Scholar, follow the link to view their profile, which includes all of their published papers (useful if you find a paper that you really like, and you’d like to read more of their work) - you can sort by the number of citations (their most popular papers) or by year (their most recent papers). Use APA format for the references. The Purdue OWL website is a handy free guide for APA formatting. If you find a reference on Google Scholar, click the image of the quotation mark to copy the APA-formatted citation. NOTE: We use APA formatting throughout this course because (1) there needs to be some kind of consistent formatting across papers, otherwise, it would be a nightmare to provide instructions (You: “How should I format my references?”) and grade (Me: “Which study is this student referring to here?”), and (2) this course is housed in a Psychology department, so (3) APA is as good a standard to follow as any other. If you are not sure how to go about completing the assignment, post your question to the Course Help Discussion Forum. Evaluation 3 points for completing the assignment. Deadline Week 4, Friday by 5:00 pm CT P.S. Example Topics Below are some examples of topics that students have selected in past semesters. You are not limited to these topics, and more than one person can choose the same topic. addiction, ADHD, agreeableness, alcohol use, alcohol &amp; nicotine, alcoholism, altruism, Alzheimer’s, anxiety, athletic ability, autism, autoimmune disorders, borderline personality disorder, circadian rhythm, cognitive ability, conduct disorder, creativity, CRISPR-Cas9 (gene editing), depression, diabetes, diabetes &amp; Alzheimer’s, drug use, dyslexia, eating disorders, economic decision making, educational attainment, empathy, exercise, externalizing (disinhibition, conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, &amp; substance use), genetic counseling, gut microbiome, handedness, income, internalizing (depression &amp; anxiety), language, methylation, methylation in depression &amp; PTSD, microbiome, musical ability, neuroticism, obesity, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, personality, pharmacogenomics, politics, procrastination, psychopathy, PTSD, resilience, schizophrenia, schizophrenia &amp; cannabis use, sexual behavior, sleep, stress-related disorders, substance use, tic disorders, Tourette’s, toxoplasmosis Project Milestone 2: 10 article summaries Before writing a paper synthesizing a field of research, you must first develop an understanding of the (often highly complex) literature of that field. We do that systematically in this course by breaking down relevant papers using a variety of Article Summary templates (which we practice using in Weeks 5, 6, &amp; 7). Objectives Identify core details from primary research articles. Identify themes/sub-topics addressed by published articles. Time Estimate 2-3 hours per article x 10 articles = 20-30 hours total. If you start in Week 5, at 2-3 papers per week, that’s 4-9 hours per week for 4 weeks. This is the LARGEST single milestone (by total time/effort/points) of the Course Project. Plan ahead to spread out your effort - you do NOT want to save this for the day before (even I don’t want to read 10 BG articles in one day). Assignment Instructions In your own words, complete an Article Summary Template for each of 10 articles related to your paper topic. Most common: For empirical articles (that is, papers reporting a new analysis of data), use the Empirical Article Summary template. Preferably no more than 1-3 articles: For review articles (that is, papers that summarize previous research with no novel analysis of data), use the Review Article Summary template. Rare for most students/topics: If you use an article whose primary purpose is to describe a method (not a result of an analysis), use the Method Summary template. You are welcome to lightly customize the templates as needed such as by adding or skipping sections (for example, if there are no figures or graphs, then you won’t have a favorite). Please number your article summaries (any order you want, just make it easy for me to refer to in feedback, e.g. “For article 7…”) and start each article summary on a new page of your document (this makes it so much easier for me to grade, and happy graders are generous graders). The primary audience for these summaries is your future self, when you start synthesizing these scholarly sources to construct your paper draft (which will be like a long version of the Topic Summary documents you wrote for your Team Learning Projects in Weeks 5 &amp; 7). The article summary templates are meant to serve as a note-taking structure based on the information that I know you’re going to need when you start writing. If you are not sure how to go about completing the assignment, post your question to the Course Help Discussion Forum. Evaluation 15 points possible (1.5 per article). You’ll receive credit for each article summary as long as it’s clear you’ve made a genuine effort to extract the relevant information. Deadline Week 8, Friday by 5:00 pm CT Project Milestone 3: Draft paper Good writing comes from editing. But before you can edit, you must draft. The goal at this stage is to get words onto paper so that we can work together to make it better. You will receive feedback on this draft from your instructor and your peers. Objectives Combine knowledge from across a variety of sources. Communicate information to a knowledgeable reviewer. Time Estimate 10-15 hours Assignment Instructions The FINAL paper will be about 3,500 to 4,500 words (12 - 18 pages) plus 10-20 references; your draft should be at least 8 pages of text (assuming double-spaced 12pt Times New Roman or 11pt Arial, not including references). The more complete your draft, however, the more useful your peer review feedback will be and the less work you’ll need to put in to produce the final version. Draft papers shorter than 8 pages or that do not address course-relevant content (behavior genetics) will not be circulated for peer review. A suggestion for how to move from your 10 article summaries to a draft of your paper: Looking across all 10 of your article summaries, make a list of what themes appear in which articles, looking especially for themes that show up in more than 1 article (see the left panel of the illustration below). Give each theme group a general but descriptive title (like, “Heritability”, “Associated Genes”, “Ethical Considerations”, “Non-Human Animal Studies”, “Developmental Effects”, “Sex Differences”, “Gene-Environment Interplay”, “Overlap with Other Phenotypes”). Relevant themes/topics will vary, but whatever is useful for organizing the themes across the articles you’ve chosen. For each empirical article summary, generate a brief paragraph-form summary of the study overall by combining information from the study specifics. For example, a basic template to get you started in many cases: “A [method] of [how many] participants found [primary finding] ([effect size], [citation]).” Create an outline/framework for your draft paper by pasting your list of themes from step 1, so now each descriptive title is a heading for a topic section. For each theme, paste sections how each relevant study (identified in step 1) relates to the theme (what you wrote for the “Explain how:” item for that theme on your article summary) from your article summary form into a paragraph under that theme’s section in your paper draft document (see the right panel of the illustration below). For each empirical study, you should include the general study details the first time you introduce it to the reader; if you reference the same study again under later topics/themes, you can give a much briefer indication of which study you’re talking about (for example, “This theme was also in the study by Derringer and colleagues (2017) discussed in the previous section, which found…”). Consider merging information from multiple articles into fewer paragraphs within a theme section. Review the Topic Summary template for examples of how to handle in-text parenthetical citations, whether there is only one source or multiple sources for a single paragraph. Read your draft so far. Go back over your summaries to copy-and-paste any text you may not yet have included that seems relevant now that you have a general structure to your paper. Additional material from your summaries of any review papers often makes excellent introductions/conclusions/transitions between sections. Before the first theme section, write an introduction: what is your topic, and why is it important? After the last theme section, write a Discussion where you briefly summarize what your above-detailed description of the current literature shows, and what in your opinion would be the best recommended next steps for research on this topic to move forward. Once you have this full rough first draft, edit. Go through these tips for self-editing your writing. Review the Good, Bad, Improve, Follow-Up checklist (generated by the class in Week 9). If you notice while editing that one (or more) of your theme sections is a little sparse, find one or two more sources on that topic to fill out what you already have. In addition to searching for new articles through Google Scholar, you may want to review what folks posted as the Easiest and most Helpful articles in the discussion forum from Week 8, for some specific recommendations from your peers. An illustration of the process to reorganize the writing you’ve done for your article summaries into a rough draft: If you are not sure how to go about completing the assignment, post your question to the Course Help Discussion Forum. Evaluation 10 points possible. See the Draft Paper Rubric below for how points will be assigned. Area of Evaluation Full Credit Criteria Half-Credit Criteria No Credit Criteria Topic Coverage Provides broad coverage of a range of behavior genetic approaches to the topic, or in-depth coverage of a specific area/methods of genetic research on the topic. [3 points] Minimal or superficial coverage of topics or methods related to course themes. [1.5 points] Presented research is not clearly related to course themes (most often: paper seems to have been written for another course). [0 points] Variety of References Information comes from a variety of primary research reports. [3 points] Too few references (&lt;10) or few-to-no primary/original articles cited. [1.5 points] Over-reliance on one or two existing review papers of the topic and/or excessive use of quotations (research findings not restated in student’s own words). [0 points] Organization Provides a coherent/logical flow between topics. Includes some elements of synthesis or overall summary. [2 points] A mix of organized and disorganized (most often: the start is there, but not complete). [1 points] Information is presented as if in list format, with no transition or synthesis across information. [0 points] Grammar &amp; Formatting Easy to read, with APA formatted in-text and reference list citations. (Does not need to be free of minor grammar or spelling errors or in final/perfect APA format, as long as content is clear and citations are present and an attempt at APA format has been made.) [2 points] Some substantial errors in grammar or formatting (most common: several instances of whole sections or reports of studies missing citations completely). [1 points] Widespread grammar/spelling errors or sentence fragments make draft unreadable. [0 points] Deadline Week 11, Friday by 5:00 pm CT Project Milestone 4: Draft popular source Very few people will ever read even the best-written academic paper. Sharing knowledge widely requires presenting it in formats that are quick and accessible. Objectives Draft a popular science communication piece to communicate what is known about your topic to a broad audience. Consider the content and organization that you used in your draft paper in a new format. Time Estimate 5-6 hours Assignment Instructions Create a brief piece (blog post, tweet thread, wikipedia page, video, infographic, graphic storytelling, or similar) to convey information about your paper topic to the public. Aim for something that would take the viewer no more than 5 minutes to engage with (for example, a 700-1000 word blog post, a 3-minute video, or a 10-20 tweets-long tweet thread). You’ll receive peer feedback on your draft during Week 13, and your Project Milestone 6: Final popular source will be scored by your peers on Engagement and Informativeness. The goal of this draft step is to structure your taking some time between drafting and finalizing your popular source, including an opportunity to see how other people are approaching the same problem and receive feedback. If you are not sure how to go about completing the assignment, post your question to the Course Help Discussion Forum. Evaluation 4 points possible (for the most part either all-or-nothing, as long as you’ve made a genuine effort to submit a reasonable attempt at a draft). Deadline Week 12, Friday by 5:00 pm CT Project Milestone 5: Paper peer reviews All good writing is editing, and peer review is a core component of the scientific process. This is an opportunity to receive feedback on your paper draft, and use the knowledge that you’ve gained to advise your peer on their papers. In this assignment, you will provide a journal-style peer review of two others’ papers. Objectives Learn to provide constructive criticism of scholarly writing. Receive suggestions to improve your own writing, both in form and content. Time Estimate 6-7 hours Assignment Instructions Provide structured, journal-style feedback on 2 others’ draft papers, which you will receive within a week of Project Milestone 3: Draft paper deadline. Follow the example peer review structure and submit each review as a separate document. If you are not sure how to go about completing the assignment, post your question to the Course Help Discussion Forum. Evaluation 5 points possible, 2.5 points for each peer review returned. Deadline Week 13, Friday by 5:00 pm CT Project Milestone 6: Final popular source This is the final version of your popular source, that will be scored by your peers for Informativeness and Engagement. Objectives Integrate feedback you received on your draft popular source. Produce a highly informative and engaging science communication piece. Time Estimate 5−6 hours Assignment Instructions Once you have your peer feedback for your draft popular source, go back to your draft and make edits as needed. Try to think about critical feedback as an indicator of something that the reviewer was interested in, but did not quite understand from what you have presented so far. As you’re editing your draft, you may want to think specifically about examples of others’ projects that you particularly liked (or didn’t) for ideas about what to do (or not) when revising your own. If you are not sure how to go about completing the assignment, post your question to the Course Help Discussion Forum. Evaluation 4 points possible. Your grade will be the average of your peers’ ratings of your project on Informativeness (out of 2 points possible) and Engagement (out of 2 points possible). Deadline Week 14, Friday by 5:00 pm CT Project Milestone 7: Final paper It’s time to go back to your draft and make improvements to produce a final document. If you have earned at least 90 points by this point in the semester, you are not required to submit a Final Paper to receive an A for the course. Objectives Integrate feedback from a variety of sources. Produce a brief report communicating current knowledge about a specific topic in behavior genetics. Time Estimate 10−15 hours Assignment Instructions Your final paper will be about 3,500 to 4,000 words (12 – 15 pages) for undergrads, or 4,000 to 4,500 words (15 – 18 pages) for grad students, plus references. It is evaluated primarily on topic coverage and synthesis, as well as organization, grammar, formatting, and responsiveness to reviewer comments. Some suggestions for how to tackle the revision process: Use your peer reviews as a checklist of issues to potentially address. Some will be straightforward, others will require some thought, and still others may just be bad suggestions that you ignore. Think about how your popular source changed as it developed. Were there any new pieces of information or new approaches to organizing your material that could be added to your paper? Review the Good-Bad-Improve-Followup checklist we generated in Week 9. For each unit of your paper (each study, each section, the paper overall), be sure that you have addressed each of the relevant issues. Go through Randy McCarthy’s suggestions for self-editing your writing. Go through the document to check for APA-style, including a title page, abstract, full list of references, and use of in-text citations. If you are not sure how to go about completing the assignment, post your question to the Course Help Discussion Forum. Evaluation 9 points possible. See the Final Paper Rubric below for how points will be assigned. Area of Evaluation Criteria for Full Credit Criteria for Half Credit Criteria for No Credit Topic Coverage Provides broad coverage of a range of behavior genetic approaches to the topic, or in-depth coverage of a specific area/method of genetic research on the topic. Information comes from a variety of primary research reports and includes the student’s own synthesis or summary of the current research literature. Concepts are clearly presented and technical terms are defined. [6 points] Coverage of the topic is superficial. Some technical terms remain undefined or there are points that are not clearly presented/described. Excessive use of quotations (research findings not restated in the student’s own words). [3 points] Presented research is not clearly related to course themes. Reliance on one or two existing review papers of the topic, instead of primary research reports. [0 points] Organization, Grammar, Formatting, Response to Peer Review Well organized and easy to follow with a clear narrative flow. Near perfect grammar and spelling. Near perfect APA style, including paper structure and formatting, title page, abstract, in-text citations, and reference list. Final paper is clearly responsive to reasonable suggestions made during peer review process. [3 points] Specific topics clearly organized into sections, but little to no transition between topics and/or lack of “big picture” summary of topic, either in introduction or conclusion sections. Several noticeable grammar or spelling errors. Several noticeable errors in APA style. Some improvements made in response to peer review but several major concerns or reasonable suggestions that were made in peer review are ignored. [1.5 points] Little to no clear organization; difficult to follow or understand topic being addressed or argument made in several sections. Frequent errors of grammar or spelling that make the paper difficult to read. Little to no evidence of use of APA style; missing a major element such as title, abstract, or citations. Little to no evidence of improvement since the peer-reviewed draft version.

Purdue Owl APA format guide We use APA formatting throughout this course because (1) there needs to be some kind of consistent formatting across papers, otherwise, it would be a nightmare to provide instructions (You: “How should I format my references?”) and grade (Me: “Which study is this student referring to here?”), and (2) this course is housed in a Psychology department, so (3) APA is as good a standard to follow as any other.

Peer Review An academic-journal-style peer review structure "],["instructor-resources.html", "Instructor Resources Teaching Human Behavior Genetics Tools Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 Week 6 Week 7 Week 8", " Instructor Resources In Progress! This appendix provides information about tools and pedagogical notes for each week. Materials on this site are shared under the GNU General Public License v3.0. Teaching Human Behavior Genetics I have one goal for this course: scientific literacy. Some features/keywords that might be used to describe elements of the course structure: asynchronous, flexible deadlines, flipped classroom, inquiry-based, contract-based grading, no exams, project-based, synchronous, time-limited teamwork, ungrading. The course is designed to be modular, flexible, and infinitely updateable. That is, parts can easily be swapped in and out as knowledge advances and as time and interests dictate. I start from the assumption that the instructional period is 14.5 weeks long, and it’s a 3 credit course (undergrad), and an expectation of 3 hours effort per week for every credit, so a total of 14.5 x 3 x 3 = about 130 hours total, over the course of a semester. If I want to scale my course to a total of 100 points, that comes out to 1.3 hours of effort per point. So I think of each point that could be earned as being “paid” in exchange for 1-1.5 hours of effort. I want half of the points to come from small scale, time-limited tasks focused on building individual skills or sub-topics of knowledge (the participation activities), and the other half to come from long-term development of expertise involving synthesis and analysis of knowledge about a specfic topic (the course project). To apply some pedagogical terminology, for the most part, participation activities are formative assessments and course project assignments are summative assessments. Tools I use the Moodle LMS and Zoom for synchronous meetings. Group work is coordinated in Moodle Discussion Forums (primarily asynchronous work) and Google Docs (primarily synchronous work/during class time). Readings are posted and accessed in Perusall for cooperative annotation. It’s linked up with Moodle so students to allow access and track user comments. Computational activities are demonstrated in R/Rstudio, because they’re free and have lots of tutorials available if students want to learn more. Some context for the teaching materials I’ve developed here: I’ve previously taught this as a 60-student class every semester, without a TA, mixed undergrad/grad students, majority Psychology or Biology majors. Next semester (end of 2021), the class size is increasing and a TA will be assigned, so the structure may change to accommodate that. I highly recommend reading The Anti-Racist Discussion Pedagogy by Dr. Selfa Chew, Dr. Akil Houston, and Dr. Alisa Cooper. Week 1 Start of Semester Student Survey Genetic Knowledge Quiz Class Chat is open Q&amp;A time Week 2 Class Chat is a lecture on the history of MAOA as a candidate gene, emphasizing (1) rush to public consciousness (research popularity, commercialization, legal applications) despite (2) limited evidence (of any consistent effect, much less something deterministic). Here are the slides. Week 3 Team Project Topic Preferences Survey Class Chat is open Q&amp;A time Week 4 Class Chat is open Q&amp;A time Week 5 I assign topics first on the basis of how many groups I’ll need, aiming for 6-8 students per group if we’re meeting in-person, 8-10 students per group is meeting virtually. (If more groups are needed than topics, double up on teams for the most popular topics.) I start with the least popular topic, and work toward the most popular, keeping track of which preference each student has been assigned to (to track later, to make sure one student doesn’t always get stuck with their 3rd choice). Prep for Tuesday is to make a shared Google Doc for each team, and start it with two sections (identical across teams/topics): First, an area bounded by horizontal lines that says “ASK QUESTIONS HERE” - when I’m keeping track of what all the groups are working on, they can leave a message for me there and I can either answer it in-text or stop by (whether we’re in-person or in virtual breakout rooms) to answer. Second, the instructions for the day. For Tuesday of Week 5, it is: Tuesday: Complete article summaries for each of the pre-selected papers for your phenotype. Each team has two empirical articles (one twin heritability study and one GWAS) and one or two review articles. Working in your team&#39;s shared google doc during the zoom session: * Copy a template from the Student Resources tab for each of your articles (either the Empirical Article Summary template, if the paper reports a new analysis of data; or the Review Article Summary, if the paper is just a review of research that has been done before and presents no new quantitative data analysis). * Work together to fill in the items on the template for each of your articles. I recommend having no fewer than 2 people working on a paper at a time. You can talk or chat in your Zoom breakout room and/or chat in the google doc itself to coordinate. * Ask for help. If there&#39;s something you can&#39;t find, or don&#39;t understand, or have a follow-up question about, either: * Ask for Help from your breakout room - click the icon of a question mark to call me; give it a couple of minutes in case I&#39;m finishing up with another team * Type your question for me into the space below, between the two horizontal lines. I&#39;ll be checking this area frequently and responding to questions I see there. START PASTING &amp; WORKING ON TEMPLATES HERE Then before Thursday I check over each of the documents for any questions to be answered or problems with the information they’ve gathered for their article summaries so far, move the Tuesday instructions (followed by the article summaries) down with a page break, and paste a new instructional message for Thursday after the Ask A Question section at the top: Thursday: Follow the Topic Summary template on the Student Resources tab to synthesize your pre-selected papers into one blog-post-length essay. (Your article summaries from Tuesday start on the next page below.) If there are any posts in your team discussion forum, you could add relevant information from those sources, as well. Be sure to include your APA-format in-text citations as you work (and add new sources to the end of your essay in a full APA-formatted reference list). START WORKING ON YOUR SUMMARY HERE Having the teams working in shared google docs makes it easy to monitor progress simultaneously and figure out if any group is falling behind. The goal is that they should be helping each other find &amp; understand, and the time pressure makes them prioritize what is most important and can reasonably be done (e.g. if there’s a small item that’s taking too long, set it aside and come back later). It also helps set reasonable and consistent expectations for effort and time that will be required to complete the article summaries for the course project - students realize it can’t be done 10 articles all at once by one person in one day, and also that the summaries don’t need to be exhaustive (find the necessary info, and take notes about what &amp; where you found it). Week 6 Teams need to be assigned simultaneously for Weeks 6 &amp; 7 - there is one article represented by each Week 6 Method x Week 7 Phenotype cross; there should be an equal number of students in each cell of that cross (e.g. if there are 60 students enrolled, there should be 1-2 students in each cell of the 6 Method x 7 Phenotype matrix) so that each area of Methodological expertise in Week 6 is represented for each application to summarizing a Phenotype in Week 7. The google doc set-up is the same, one for each team with an ASK QUESTIONS HERE area at the top, followed by instructions. For Tuesday: Tuesday: Work on article summaries for the pre-selected papers for your method. Each team has one general overview and 4-6 empirical papers applying the method to one or more of the phenotypes we’ll be covering in Week 7. The goal for Thursday will be to complete a Method Summary, so take a look at that for an idea of what you might focus on during today’s activity (see the Method Summary template at the bottom of the Resources tab) Working in your team&#39;s shared google doc during the zoom session: * Choose which articles to start with (1 per every 2 people in attendance today). You probably won’t get through them all, so pick based on which seem most useful/interesting to start. * Copy a template from the Student Resources tab for each of your articles (either the Empirical Article Summary template, if the paper reports a new analysis of data; or the Review Article Summary, if the paper is just a review of research that has been done before and presents no new quantitative data analysis). * Work together to fill in the items on the template for each of your articles. Focus in particular on any section(s) that specifically address your method. Some of these articles (especially GWAS) cover much more than just your assigned method - try using ctrl-F to search for method keywords, and don’t be shy about going to dig through supplemental materials if they are referenced in the main text. * Ask for help. If there&#39;s something you can&#39;t find, or don&#39;t understand, or have a follow-up question about, either: * Ask for Help from your breakout room - click the icon of a question mark to call me; give it a couple of minutes in case I&#39;m finishing up with another team * Type your question for me into the space above, between the two horizontal lines. I&#39;ll be checking that area frequently and responding to questions I see there. START PASTING &amp; WORKING ON ARTICLE SUMMARY TEMPLATES HERE For Thursday Thursday: Using your article summaries from Tuesday&#39;s session and any resources that have been posted to your team discussion forum so far, fill out a Method Summary template (see the Student Resources tab) about your team&#39;s assigned method. If there&#39;s something you can&#39;t find, or don&#39;t understand, or have a follow-up question about, either: * Ask for Help from your breakout room - click the icon of a question mark to call me; give it a couple of minutes in case I&#39;m finishing up with another team; or * Type your question for me into the space above, between the two horizontal lines. I&#39;ll be checking that area frequently and responding to questions I see there. PASTE &amp; FILL OUT YOUR METHOD SUMMARY HERE Week 7 Tuesday google doc instructions for each team (I copy over the article summaries from Week 6 for them to start from; some articles will have been covered by several Methods teams): Tuesday: Work on article summaries for the pre-selected papers for your phenotype. Each team has 4-7 empirical papers applying methods from Week 6 to your phenotype. The goal for Thursday will be to complete a Topic Summary addressing the question: What causes (or is caused by) your phenotype?, so keep that goal in mind as you complete your article summaries (either anew, or editing/completing the ones begun by the methods teams last week). Working in your team&#39;s shared google doc during the zoom session: * Choose which articles to start with (1 per every 2 people in attendance today). You probably won’t get through them all, so pick based on which seem most useful/interesting to start. * Copy an Empirical Article template from the Student Resources tab for each of your articles. * Work together to fill in the items on the template for each of your articles. * Some of these articles (especially GWAS) cover many different methods and can draw a range of conclusions. Be sure to identify those that will be useful for your causal reasoning goals and don’t be shy about going to dig through supplemental materials if they are referenced in the main text. * Ask for help. If there&#39;s something you can&#39;t find, or don&#39;t understand, or have a follow-up question about, either: * Ask for Help from your breakout room - click the icon of a question mark to call me; give it a couple of minutes in case I&#39;m finishing up with another team * Type your question for me into the space above, between the two horizontal lines. I&#39;ll be checking that area frequently and responding to questions I see there. ARTICLE SUMMARIES FROM WEEK 6 METHODS APPEAR BELOW Thursday’s instructions: Thursday: Follow the Topic Summary template on the Student Resources tab to synthesize your pre-selected papers into one blog-post-length essay. Be sure to include your APA-format in-text citations as you work (and add new sources to the end of your essay in a full APA-formatted reference list). The topic your essay will address is: What causes (or is caused by) your phenotype? Week 8 "]]
