# 9.0 Cognitive Ability, Educational Attainment, & Gene-Environment Correlation

<!---

	As the themes repeatedly state, we don't expect there to be a simple connection between genes and complex behaviors. This week we will be exploring methods for understanding gene-environment interplay.

This week we will:

Discuss how self- and other-selection into environments progresses over development
Consider common theories of "risk" where the outcome is more than the sum of its parts
Understand tradeoffs among research designs that allow for the estimation of gene-environment interplay
