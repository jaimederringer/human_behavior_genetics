title: 1.0 What We Know and What We Don't

----------

This first part is all about introductions.

Behavior Genetics is a field that is defined by a common set of questions and methods, rather than being focused on any particular topic of study. This week we discuss some of the commonalities, or themes, that recur throughout research across topics, in terms of the questions we ask, what we know, and what we don't (and maybe can't) know.

This week we will:

- Introduce common terminology and themes in behavior genetics.
- Become comfortable with the typical weekly course structure.
- Evaluate and share what knowledge you come to this course with and what you hope to learn.
