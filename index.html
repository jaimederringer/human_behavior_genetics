          <h1>Goals</h1>
          <p>There are no prerequisites for Psyc 408. If you think the material
            sounds interesting, this class is for you. This semester, we will: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understand how the basic principles of genetics can be used in
              the study of behavior.</li>
            <li>Evaluate the extent to which human individual differences are
              influenced by genes</li>
            <li>Consider the implications of genetic knowledge in psychology.</li>
          </ul>
          <p> This is a highly interactive class. Success depends on students
            learning from and respecting one another. This respect includes the
            time and effort contributed by each student to the learning of the
            group. </p>
          <p> The aim of this course is to provide students with a clearer
            understanding of the contribution that genes make to individual
            differences in behavior. Students will be in a better position to
            evaluate evidence for and against genetic and environmental
            influences. They will also gain an appreciation of the
            interrelationships of biological and social causes of behavior and
            will gain a better understanding of influences that might affect
            themselves and others. </p>
          <p> The course will be intellectually demanding, and will require a
            substantial amount of reading, active participation in discussion, and
            attentive development of a serious term paper. The course will
            require about 9 hours per week. If you have any concerns about your preparedness for
            this course, please contact the instructor. </p>

		<p> <strong>Participation activities and course project assignments are scaled such that each point earned is expected to correspond to about 1 to 1.5 hours of effort</strong>, including time required to both prepare (eg. read articles, view lectures) and complete (eg. write) the task.</a>
          <h4 class="w3-padding-32"> Participation (50 points*) </h4>
	      <p>Participation points are earned by completing smaller tasks each week, and are due by Friday 5pm of the week for which they are assigned. You can earn up to 4 participation points per week, by choosing to complete activities from a list of options. Some activity options will be held synchronously via Zoom during regularly scheduled class sesions (such as Class Chats and Co-Working Sessions), but each week will include at least 4 asynchronous activity options that can be completed at any time. </p>
	      <p>*Given that there are 15 class weeks of the semester (not including Fall Break), you could earn as many as 60 points for participation (15 weeks x 4 points per week); the extra 10 points are intended to serve as an "absence" buffer that you are invited to take (ie. skip) for any reason or no reason at all.</p>
	      <h4 class="w3-padding-32"> Course Project (50 points) </h4>
          <p> You may choose any topic related to the course content (behavior genetics), as long as
            I approve it. You will produce a final paper of about 3,500 to 4,000 words
            (12 – 15 pages) for undergrads, or 4,000 to 4,500 words (15 – 18
            pages) for grad students, plus references. I care more about
            clarity, insight, evidence, and the flow of argument than about
            length. Expect to read at least 10 – 20 published research papers on
            your topic of choice. For graduate students, plan to produce a paper
            that you could turn around and submit as a review in a decent
            journal or a book chapter. </p>
          <p>Graduate students’ performance is evaluated against higher
            expectations for intellectual rigor, argument, and synthesis.
            Undergrads and grad students are graded separately. </p>
          <p>All assignments are due by 5 pm on their listed due dates
            (always Friday, unless noted otherwise). </p>

<li>[phenotype] genetics</li>
            </ul>
<p>Google Scholar sorts results to prioritize highly cited papers. You may want to restrict to recent publication years so you don't get a bunch of out-of-date research (for example, select the 'Since 2016' option at top left). If you find a paper you like, look for papers that that paper cites, or that cite that paper (click the 'Cited by' link under the reference listing in Google Scholar). Where an author's name is underlined in the reference listing, follow the link to view their profile, which includes all of their published papers (useful if you find a paper that you really like, and you'd like to read more of their work) - you can sort by number of citations (their most popular papers) or by year (their most recent papers).</p> 
            <p>Use APA format for the references. The <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_author_authors.html">Purdue
                OWL website</a> is a handy free guide for APA formatting. If you
              find a reference on Google
                Scholar, click the image of the quotation mark to copy the
              APA-formatted citation.</p>

            <p>A suggestion for how to move from your 10 article
              summaries to a draft of your paper:</p>

              <li>Sort your 10 article summaries 
                into 2-4 thematically/topically similar groups</li>
              <li>Give each theme or topic group a descriptive title (like,
                "Heritability", "Associated Genes", "Ethical Considerations",
                "Non-Human Animal Studies", "Developmental Effects", "Sex
                Differences", "Gene-Environment Interplay", "Overlap with Other
                Phenotypes" - relevant topics will vary, but whatever is useful
                for organizing the articles you've summarized)</li>
              <li>Paste relevant (to the assigned theme or topic group) excerpts describing the study or review from your article summary form into a paragraph.</li>
	      <li>Paste article paragraph-form summaries together by sub-topic. Consider merging information from multiple articles into fewer paragraphs.</li>
		    <li>Review the <a href="https://jaimederringer.github.io/psyc408/docs/template_topic_summary.html">Topic Summary template</a> for examples of how to handle in-text parenthetical citations, whether there is only one source or multiple sources for a single paragraph.</li> 
	      <li>Paste
                the sub-topics together, including the descriptive title as the
                sub-header for that section.</li>
              <li>Before the first topic, write an introduction: what is your
                topic, and why is it important?</li>
              <li>After the last topic, write a Discussion section where you
                briefly summarize what your above detailed description of the
                current literature shows, and what in your opinion would be the
                best recommended next steps for research on this topic to move
                forward.</li>
		    <li>Once you have this rough first draft, edit. Go through <a href="https://randyjmccarthy.com/2019/11/14/self-editing-your-writing/">these tips for self-editing your writing</a>. Review <a href="docs/editing_good_bad_improve_followup.html">the good, the bad, the improvements, and the follow-up questions that appear in writing for a general audience</a>.</li>
              <li>If you notice while editing that one (or more) of your
                subtopics is a little sparse, find additional research on that
                topic to fill out what you already have.</li>

	    <h3 class="w3-padding-32"> Late Work Policy </h4>
	    <p>Course project assignments are timed to allow for sustained building of knowledge throughout the semester, taking into account the need for timely feedback. Please do your best to meet the given deadlines for course project assignments. Because the course project assignments are designed to build on one another sequentially, <strong>an assignment may be submitted and will be graded as usual (that is, no late penalty) until the next assignment deadline</strong>. This policy also applies to resubmissions (that is, if you are disappointed with your initial grade on a course project assignment, you may resubmit it up until the next assignment deadline). Note that late assignment submissions may not receive peer feedback.</p>
