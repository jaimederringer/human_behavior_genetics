title: Course Project, Final Popular Source

---

This is the final version of your popular source, that will be scored by your peers for Informativeness and Engagement.

## Objectives

- Integrate feedback you received on your draft popular source.
- Produce a highly informative and engaging science communication piece.

## Time Estimate

5 hours (assuming you're working from an existing draft)

## Assignment Instructions

Once you have your peer feedback for your draft popular source, go back to your draft and make edits as needed. Try to think about critical feedback as an indicator of something that the reviewer was interested in, but did not quite understand from what you have presented so far. As you're editing your draft, you may want to think specifically about examples of others' projects that you particularly liked (or didn't) for ideas about what to do (or not) when revising your own.

## Evaluation

5 points possible. Your grade will be the average of your peers' ratings of your project on Informativeness (out of 2.5 points possible) and Engagement (out of 2.5 points possible).
