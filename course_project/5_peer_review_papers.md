# Course Project Part 5. Peer Review Papers

All good writing is editing, and peer review is a core component of the scientific process. This is an opportunity to receive feedback on your paper draft, and to use the knowledge that you've gained to advise your peers on their papers. In this assignment, you will provide a [journal-style peer review](../materials/template_peer_review.md) of two other students' draft papers.

## Objectives

- Learn to provide constructive criticism of academic writing.
- Receive suggestions to improve your own writing, both in form and content.

## Time Estimate

5 hours

## Assignment Instructions

Provide structured, journal-style feedback on 2 other students' draft papers, which you will receive within a week of the [Draft Paper](3_draft_paper.md) deadline as an email from Jaime (jderr@illinois.edu) with the subject "PSYC 408 Papers for peer review". [Follow the example peer review structure](../materials/template_peer_review.md) and submit each review as a separate document. Peer reviews must be written up in paragraph/bullet-list format separately from the manuscript document; DO NOT submit your review as comments added to the manuscript document.

## Evaluation

4 points possible, 2 points for each peer review returned. For the most part all-or-nothing on each review completed. Follow the golden rule: review others as you would like to be reviewed.
