## <a id="goals"></a>Goals

* Understand how the basic principles of genetics can be used in the study of behavior
* Evaluate the extent to which human individual differences are influenced by genes
* Consider the implications of genetic knowledge in psychology

The aim of this course is to provide students with a clearer understanding of the contribution that genes make to individual differences in behavior. Students will be in a better position to evaluate evidence for and against genetic and environmental influences. They will also gain an appreciation of the interrelationships of biological and social causes of behavior and will gain a better understanding of influences that might affect themselves and others.

This is a highly interactive class. Success depends on students learning from and respecting one another. This respect includes the time and effort contributed by each student to the learning of the group.

The course will be intellectually demanding, and will require a substantial amount of reading, active in-class discussion, and attentive development of a serious term paper. The course will require about 3 to 6 hours per week outside class for readings and assignments. If you have any concerns about your preparedness for this course, please talk with the instructor.

## <a id="grades"></a>Grades

All assignments are due by 11:59 pm on their [listed due dates](#overview). **Late assignments lose 20% credit per calendar day.** Assignments due on Thursday reduce to 80% of the earned points if submitted on Friday, 60% on Saturday, 40% on Sunday, 20% on Monday.

Graduate students’ performance is evaluated against higher expectations for intellectual rigor, argument, and synthesis. Undergrads and grad students are graded separately. Grad students are expected to complete a longer term paper (minimum 15 pages).

Assignments total 100 points. Grades are assigned based on your final point total at the end of the semester. There is no extra credit in this class.

| Letter Grade | Point Total |
|--------------|-------------|
| A | 90 – 100 |
| B | 80 – 89.999 |
| C | 70 – 79.999 |
| D | 60 – 69.999 |
| F | < 60 |

### Attendance & Participation (30% total grade)

Attendance will be split into thirds (10% each), closed out in weeks 5 (26 Sep), 10 (31 Oct), and 15 (10 Dec). If you miss more than one day in a given third of the class, you may make-up the points by submitting ([email](mailto:jderr@illinois.edu)) a 500-word essay on the topic(s) covered within 1 week.

# Term Paper (50% total grade)

You may choose any topic related to the course content, as long as I approve it. The final paper should be about 3,500 to 4,000 words (12 – 15 pages) for undergrads, or 4,000 to 4,500 words (15 – 18 pages) for grad students, plus references. I care more about clarity, insight, evidence, and the flow of argument than about length. Expect to read at least 10 – 20 published research papers on your topic of choice. For graduate students, plan to produce a paper that you could turn around and submit as a review in a decent journal or a book chapter. 

* [Draft bibliography](https://jaimederringer.github.io/psyc408/activities#draft-bibliography) (5%): A list of at least 5 primary research articles related to your topic.
* [Annotated bibliography](https://jaimederringer.github.io/psyc408/activities#annotated-bibliography) (15%): Summaries of at least 10 primary research articles related to your topic.
* [Draft paper](https://jaimederringer.github.io/psyc408/activities#draft-paper) (10%): Evaluated on topic coverage, reference variety, organization, and grammar.
* Blog post (5%): Draft and final versions, before and after in-class peer review.
* [Peer review](https://jaimederringer.github.io/psyc408/activities#peer-review) (5%): Provide structured, journal-style feedback on 2 others’ papers.
* [Final paper](https://jaimederringer.github.io/psyc408/activities#final-paper) (10%): Evaluated on topic coverage, organization, grammar, APA formatting, and responsiveness to reviewer comments.

### Reflection Essays (20% total grade)

After each of the first two Topic Roulette weeks, Gattaca week, and the Genetics at Trial week, you will write a 250- to 500-word essay (5% each) reflecting on the core themes under discussion that week.

## <a id="schedule"></a>Schedule

Free versions of assigned readings are linked wherever possible. Assigned readings that are only available behind a paywall are posted for students on the UIUC-login-required course site at [https://compass2g.illinois.edu/](https://compass2g.illinois.edu/). 

Lectures in the first half of the semester are focused on building a basis of knowledge about concepts, methods, and themes in human behavior genetics. Readings for these weeks are intended to complement material presented in class; you are encouraged to at least skim the readings before lecture, and then go back and read for more depth/detail after lecture.

Weeks labeled Topic Roulette, Discussion, and Workshop will be taught in a 'flipped classroom' approach. You are expected to do assigned readings before the Tuesday class, so that you can fully participate in the in-class activities.

A major course goal is completion of a substantial term paper. In any weeks where the assigned readings are relatively light, it is assumed that you will be reading papers for your term paper.
