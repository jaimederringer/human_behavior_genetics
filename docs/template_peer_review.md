Title: **[TITLE OF PAPER]**

*Opening paragraph gives a general summary of the paper topic and the
          major general strengths and weaknesses.*

This paper **[DESCRIBE THE PAPER TOPIC]**.

The paper does a good job of **[GIVE A GENERAL STRENGTH OF THE PAPER:
          E.G. INTERESTING, BROAD COVERAGE, DEEP COVERAGE OF NARROW TOPIC, EASY
          TO UNDERSTAND, ETC.]**.

The primary way to improve this paper would be to **[GIVE YOUR MOST
          GENERAL RECOMMENDATION: E.G. EDIT SPELLING AND GRAMMAR, PROVIDE A
          SUMMARY AND POSSIBLE FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH AT THE END,
          EXPLAIN TECHNICAL TERMS MORE CLEARLY, FOCUS ON A MORE NARROW FIELD OF
          RESEARCH, FOCUS ON BROADER ASPECTS OF THE RESEARCH TOPIC, REORGANIZE
          TEXT TO IMPROVE FLOW, ETC.]**.
          
The author clearly put a lot of effort in to **[ONE MORE STRENGTH TO
          FINISH THE “COMPLEMENT SANDWICH”: E.G. INTERESTING, BROAD COVERAGE,
          DEEP COVERAGE OF NARROW TOPIC, EASY TO UNDERSTAND, ETC.]**.
          
*Now give bullet points or a numbered list with specific comments or
          questions. Provide concrete suggestions for improvement, as much as
          possible. You might want to suggest other behavior genetics topics or
          methods to include. Do not bother correcting spelling/grammar, unless
          there’s something that will be very hard for the author to spot.*
* The statement on page 2, “The heritability of the disorder is…”
          needs a citation.
* The sentence on page 3, “However, researchers have also seen that
          sex differences...” is difficult to understand. I interpreted it to
          mean **[HOW YOU READ IT]**.
* The organization is difficult to follow. You might want to discuss
          problems of diagnosis before problems of treatment.
* On page 6, second paragraph, you use the word “affect” when I think
          you mean “effect”.
* You talk a lot about the heritability of the outcome. Have any
          specific genes been found that are associated with it?
* On page 9, you mention “methylation”, but do not define it for the
          reader.

*Remember to offer **constructive criticism**. Review others as you would like to be reviewed.*
