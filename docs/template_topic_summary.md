## An Informative And Engaging Title That Doesn't Oversell And Is Probably Shorter Than This One

Start with a paragraph that describes the phenotype (or whatever topic) to the reader. What is it? What is it NOT? Why does it matter/why did you pick it? How could information from behavior genetic methods help us understand this topic?

**A Theme/Subheading** (eg. Heritability of X)

A paragraph that summarizes research pertaining to this theme. It may come from one source, or from many. Please use APA parenthetical citations in text (Derringer, 2018).

Be sure to include the details of a study that are necessary for the reader to understand its finding and implications. For examples of common academic-sounding phrases to use to describe research see [the Academic Phrasebank](http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/).

**A Second Theme/Subheading** (eg. Genes Associated with X)

A paragraph that summarizes research pertaining to this theme (Derringer, 2018). If there are multiple sources within the same paragraph, provide a citation after every continiguous block of information. So if there are two consecutive sentences from one source, you do not need a citation at the end of each sentence (Derringer, 2019). Please use APA parenthetical citations in text (Derringer, 2018). 

**A Third Theme/Subheading** (what is a third interesting thing you want to tell the reader?)

Derringer (2020) noted that every paragraph that contains anything other than your own opinion should have at least one citation. If an entire paragraph comes from a single source, then that citation goes at either the begining or the end of the paragraph.

Each paragraph is its own block of information. So if there are two paragraphs that all come from the same source, you still need one citation per paragraph (Derringer, 2020).

**Discussion** (summary conclusions, call-to-action/suggestions for future research)

Wrap it up with a very brief overview of what is known and what is not known. What do you, as the author(s) of the topic summary, recommend as the next step for advancing our understanding of this topic? Do we need bigger samples? Better measurement? To focus more on understudied factors?
