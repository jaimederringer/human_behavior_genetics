# Team Project Topic Preferences

I use these preferences to assign folks to groups for Team Projects in Weeks 5, 6, 7, and 12 (plus a peer review activity in Week 9). I can usually get everyone into one of their top-3 choices for each week.

| Week 6, causal reasoning methods: Rank your first, second, etc. preferences (what are you most/least interested in?)
