# Method Summary template

## Method Name

**Data requirements:** How many participants do we need? What kind of data? Any special characteristics of those participants (eg. twins, not humans)? What information do we need to plan the analysis (eg. previously identified genes)?

**Assumptions:** Does the method rely on any assumptions? Do they seem reasonable?

**In plain language, how does it work?**

**Typical output: Effect sizes? Common graphs?** How are the results usually reported and evaluated? What effect sizes are typical? 

**Examples:** As brief and clear as possible, no more than a few sentences. Use the examples to illustrate the idea, not necessarily fully describe a study.

* Example 1:
    * Citation

* Example 2:
    * Citation

* Example 3:

**What are we able to conclude from this method?**

**Can it tell us if genes cause behavior in humans?** Why or why not?
