title: 8.0 Autism, Heterogeneity & Disability Perspectives

----------

<!-----
	Although behavior genetic methods can be applied to any phenotype you can imagine, some have received more attention than others. This week we will be discussing two of the most researched phenotypes in human behavior genetics: schizophrenia and autism.

This week we will:

Explore how different approaches to sampling participants can provide insight into influences on common psychiatric diagnoses.
Understand how experimental methods in non-human model organisms can explain biological mechanisms of human differences.
Consider different perspectives on the question of what can - or should - be done when genetic influences are identified.
