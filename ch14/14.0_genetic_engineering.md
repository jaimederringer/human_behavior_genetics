title: 14.0 Genetic Engineering

---

Identifying specific genetic variants associated with human behavior, coupled with advancing technologies, has changed the possibilities for genetic manipulation. This week we will discuss ways in which genetic editing and selection are currently being applied to human phenotypes, both in adults as part of clinical trials for the treatment of medical disorders, as well as during reproductive decision-making.

This week we will:

- Review the recent history of human genetic engineering.
- Understand the potential and limitations of current technologies to test and alter the human genome.
- Consider frameworks for genetic decision-making for the self and others and evaluate the extent of disagreement around the boundaries of appropriate application.
