## Activities

Identify and discuss behavior genetics themes in a fictional or artistic work. Find a fictional or artistic portrayal of genetic testing or engineering and connect it to three of the themes in behavior genetics.

You can pick anything - feel free to be creative and/or esoteric. A few examples:

- Gattaca (1997): [this YouTube playlist of 8 short clips + the trailer](http://j.mp/1J8UoJw) hits the important points in <20 minutes.
- Any of the Jurassic Parks: Not about humans, but there's plenty of discussion of complex behavioral phenotypes, genes, and environments.
- You could absolutely analyze three themes relevant to the opening line of Lizzo's Truth Hurts, "I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that b\*tch."

- Start by briefly naming and describing what fictional or artistic work you are discussing (give me enough detail that I could look it up).
- Select any three themes in behavior genetics.
- For each theme, write a brief (100-200 words) description of how that theme relates to the fictional portrayal of genetics.
